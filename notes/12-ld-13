    <br>

    <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. Many innocent people lose their lives in ruthless attacks every year. What do you think the governments
        should do to protect their people from such attacks and make the world a safer place to live? Discuss with your
        friends.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Yes, it&rsquo;s true that many innocent people lose their lives in ruthless attacks every year. The government
    must be responsible to handle and control such situations. It should think seriously for the security of their
    citizens from such ruthless attacks. The things the government should do to protect their people from such
    attacks and make the world a safer place to live are as follows:
    <br>
    <br>
    - Every government should maintain stability in them, the leaders and the political parties.
    <br>
    - Borders restrictions should be done.
    <br>
    - Armed forces should be kept at several places where there is the high risk of attack outbreaks.
    <br>
    - Though the peace treaty are being signed but not followed accordingly. So every nation should work to maintain
    peace.
    <br>
    - Peoples should be moved to safer place if there is any danger.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <span>
        b. Revenge and violence are the integral parts of the history and civilization. They can't be ignored, only
        managed. Do you agree or not with this statement? Present your logic.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Yes, I agree with the statement that revenge and violence are the integral parts of the history and
    civilization. Revenge is associated with hurt and damage, and violence is the use of physical force so as to
    injure, abuse, damage, or destroy. The cause of World War II is also due to the Revenge from German, in 1919
    June 28. When the Treaty of Versailles was signed and the war between German and Allied Power was ended, it
    humiliated and blamed Germany for World War I and imposed heavy debt payments on Germany. Germany revenged for
    it in 1939 and from that World War II had stared. We have seen from our past that revenge and violence and lead
    to a miserable situation. Thus, it can&rsquo;t be ignored, but only managed.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <br>
    <span>A. Write a description of an event that you have recently witnessed.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Recently I witnessed a very special celestial event known as the full lunar eclipse. It was special because
    astronomers declared it to be longest lunar eclipse of this century which took place on July 27. It was
    difficult for me because I had to wake up till late night for watching this lunar eclipse. Finally the eclipse
    started at 11:30 pm and ended at 1 a.m. I was accompanied by a few friends who chose to witness this lunar
    eclipse. We kept looking up in the sky for one and a half hours which was a bit difficult but rewarding in the
    end.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <span>
        B. Human life does not pass as one expects. You might have also gone through different but memorable incidents.
        Write an essay on &quot;An Unforgettable Event in my Life' in about 500 words.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    It is true that if we have joys in our life we have sorrows too. Like all others, I cannot be an exception. I
    still remember the day when I felt that there is no joy in the world but sorrow.
    <br>
    <br>
    I was enjoying the vacations after my tenth class board ex-examinations. My best friend in the neighborhood,
    Alisha, was staying with me. Her parents had gone to Kathmandu where her grandfather was to undergo some major
    operation. I and my parents did our best to keep her happy and away from missing her parents. For us it was play
    time all through the day.
    <br>
    <br>
    One evening as we were playing our little brain game, her parents called and said her grandfather&rsquo;s
    operation was successful and her parents were to return the next day by plane. On reading it Alisha was
    overjoyed and I joined her in her moment of happiness.
    <br>
    <br>
    That night Alisha did not sleep. She counted the hours till the early morning. We dressed hurriedly and my
    father took us to the airport. On reaching there we sensed something wrong. The Yeti Airlines flight from
    Kathmandu had crashed while landing. Fire tenders and ambulances were on the run. Our hearts sank. Alisha
    fainted from shock. My father hired a taxi and sent us back home.
    <br>
    <br>
    We waited with throbbing hearts for my father to return with her safe and sound parents. My mother sent for a
    doctor as Alisha&rsquo;s condition became worse. I sat by her side silently wishing for a happy turn. My father
    returned only to say that there was no sign of her parents though their names were mentioned in the
    airline&rsquo;s passenger list. Alisha was hysterical and it became difficult to control her.
    <br>
    <br>
    She said that she wanted to go to her home. I decided to go with her while my mother would soon follow. Once out
    on the street she ran towards her home. I saw a speeding car and shouted after her to stop. She didn&rsquo;t.
    The car didn&rsquo;t stop and sped away leaving her laying on the road badly hurt.
    <br>
    <br>
    We immediately took her to a nearby hospital. The doctors who examined her said she may recover gradually but
    did not confirm her recovery. She was placed in the intensive care unit.
    <br>
    <br>
    I returned home with my parents. The moment we entered the room the telephone rang. It was a call from the
    hospital to inform that Alisha was no more. I felt numb and tears welled up in my eyes. I still refused to
    believe what I heard was true.
    <br>
    <br>
    Again, the telephone rang and it was from Alisha&rsquo;s parents to inform that they had missed their flight due
    to some car trouble on their way to the airport. The news of Alisha&rsquo;s parents as alive did not touch my
    heart.
    <br>
    <br>
    Alisha&rsquo;s parents were shocked to hear about their daughter&rsquo;s death when they came home next day. But
    nothing could be done. Even today when I remember the incident every moment of that day flashes through my eyes
    and I begin to cry, &ldquo;Alisha, why did you have to die? I have lost a good friend in you.&rdquo;

    <br>
    <br>

    <span>C. Complete the following text with correct prepositions.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    What are we seeing here? One very real possibility is that these are the educational consequences of the
    differences <b>in</b> parenting styles that we talked about <b>in</b> the Chris Langan chapter. Think back to Alex Williams,
    the nine-year-old whom Annette Lareau studied. His parents believe <b>in</b> connected cultivation. He gets taken <b>to</b>
    museums and gets enrolled <b>in</b> special programs and goes <b>to</b> summer camp, where he takes classes. When he's bored
    <b>at</b> home, there are plenty of books to read, and his parents see it as their responsibility to keep him actively
    engaged <b>in</b> the world <b>for</b> him. It's hard to see how Alex would get better <b>at</b> reading and math <b>in</b> the summer.
