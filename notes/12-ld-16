    Morning&rdquo;.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. Describe the physical appearance of the young lady.</span>
    <br>
    She was beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic. She forewent the pomp of the alluring pompadour. She
    wore no chains, bracelets or lockets. She had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to luncheon. Her
    dress was grey and plain, but it fitted her figure with fidelity and discretion. In her neat black turban hat was
    the gold-green wing of a macaw. On this morning she was softly and shyly radiant. Her eyes were dreamily bright, her
    cheeks genuine peachblow, her expression a happy one, tinged with reminiscence.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. What changes did Pitcher notice in the young lady?</span>
    <br>
    Pitcher noticed a difference in her ways this morning. Instead of going straight into the adjoining room, where her
    desk was, she lingered, slightly irresolute, in the outer office. Once she moved over by Maxwell&rsquo;s desk, near
    enough for him to be aware of her presence.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. What was Pitcher&rsquo;s reply to the young lady concerning a new stenographer?</span>
    <br>
    Pitcher&rsquo;s reply to the young lady concerning a new stenographer was that Maxwell had already told him to get
    another stenographer and then he had notified agency a day before to send over a few samples that morning and none
    of the candidates arrived till the time except her.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. What proposal did Maxwell make with Miss Leslie?</span>
    <br>
    Maxwell made a marriage proposal with Miss Leslie.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>f. How did she react to his proposal?</span>
    <br>
    She acted very queerly when he proposed her. At first she seemed overcome with amazement; then tears flowed from her
    wondering eyes; and then she smiled sunnily through them, and one of her arms slid tenderly about the broker&rsquo;s
    neck.
