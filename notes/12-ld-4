    <h3>Comprehension</h3>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>a. What is a hyperloop? How does it work?</span>
    <br>

    <br>
    A hyperloop is an ultra-high-speed ground transportation
    system for passenger and cargo. It works on the low-friction environment in a &quot;floating&quot; pod which shoots
    through
    giant, low-pressure tubes, either above or below ground.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>b. How is hyperloop more beneficial than the traditional trains?</span>
    <br>
    A hyperloop could be cheaper and faster than train or car travel, and cheaper and less
    polluting than air travel. It is also quicker and cheaper to build than traditional highspeed rail. Therefore,
    hyperloop is more beneficial than the traditional trains.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>c. Does hyperloop have a successful history? How?</span>
    <br>
    Although the idea of using low-pressure or vacuum tubes as part of a transport system were used to send mail and
    packages between small distances but travelling of a passenger through it have not been possible. Many ideas like
    'vactrain' concept developed by Robert
    Goddard have been proposed without much success. Thus, hyperloop does not have a successful history.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>d. Write the contributions of Robert Goddard and Elon Musk for the development of hyperloop.</span>
    <br>
    In order to provide ultra-fast intercity transport, Space X and Tesla founder Elon Musk created the hyperloop idea.
    In addition to automobiles, aircraft, boats, and trains, Elon envisions a &quot;fifth mode of transportation&quot;
    that utilises travel pods housed within steel tubes. He revived interest in the idea of hyperloop in August 2013
    with his 'Hyperloop Alpha' paper.
    <br>

    <br>
    The 'vactrain' idea, created by Robert Goddard in the early 20th century, is clearly a prototype of the hyperloop.
    Since then, a slew of similar concepts have been proposed.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>e. What relation does speed have with air resistance? Explain.</span>
    <br>
    The increase in speed leads to an increase in the amount of air resistance. Eventually, the force of air resistance
    becomes large enough to balances the force of gravity and hence the object will stop accelerating.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>f. What are hyperloop capsules compared with? How are they similar?</span>
    <br>
    Hyperloop capsules are compared with Boeing 747s. They are similar in the sense that they both accelerate at the
    same rate of speed.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>g. How do the passengers feel while travelling via hyperloop? What will be done to make it luxurious?</span>
    <br>
    While travelling via hyperloop, the passengers feel about the same as riding in an elevator or a passenger plane.
    The beautiful landscape will be displayed in the cabin and each passenger will be given access to their
    entertainment system to make it more luxurious.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>h. Why does the writer doubt about the success of hyperloop? What does the success depend on?</span>
    <br>
    The writer doubts about the success of the hyperloop because till the date, hyperloop is only a conceptul technology. It's a huge, multibillion dollar and, as yet, unanswered question. He thinks that this technology may have just caught up with the concept. The success of the hyperloop will
    vary depending on the destinations, local economics, and geography.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>
        a. Is the hyperloop the future of transportation or just a dream? What do you think? Justify your opinion with
        suitable reasons.
    </span>
    <br>

    <br>
    Basically, Hyperloop is a conceptual transport system in which passengers are loaded into pods and fired through
    vacuum tubes all at a supersonic speed. Hyperloop isn't just about speed; it also aims to be environmentally
    friendly.
    <br>
    The concept just like of Hyperloop is not new though. Pneumatic tubes for the parcel, mail, and money transfers
    found widespread acceptance in the 19th century and are still used at supermarkets, postal sorting stations, and
    banks today. Hyperloop's concept resembles the pneumatic mail delivery systems. Even flying on the air seemed to be
    impossible on past days but now travelling via air is common for us. So no one can say that it&rsquo;s not possible
    because everything which was a dream once, is reality now.
    <br>

    <br>
    In conclusion, we can see that Hyperloop may become the future of transportation systems worldwide. If this becomes
    a reality, even though it is not expected for decades, there will be an immense impact on ordinary people's lives.
    Apart from the convenience and the green impact, we can also hope for economic success.
    <br>

    <br>
    However, despite the immense promise, new technologies take time, and will be a while until we can travel in a pod
    inside a sealed tube with a sound only as loud as a gentle 'SWOOSH.'
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>
        b. The number of private vehicles is increasing day by day in Nepal beyond the capacity of our infrastructure.
        What do you think should be done to curb the ever-growing number of private vehicles? Discuss.
    </span>
    <br>

    <br>
    The number of private vehicles is increasing day by day in Nepal beyond the capacity of our infrastructure and is
    outpacing the country's infrastructure. The number of Nepalese who own personal cars is steadily increasing. Despite
    the fact that it eases their day to day life, its causing great environmental loses. Private vehicles should be
    prohibited since their widespread usage degrades the environment and increases emissions of hazardous gases that
    will create major problems in the future. To control this critical situation some safety measures had to be
    taken.
    <br>

    <br>
    The best approach is to discourage people from opting to buy cars. This can be effectively done by increasing toll
    fare for cars and by devising a system of progressive taxation on cars. The system can have an upper limit on the
    number of cars owned per family and the rate of tax on each car can be increased as the number of cars bought keep
    rising.
    <br>

    <br>
    But these efforts would be meaningless unless they are accompanied by measures to encourage people to use public
    transport by revamping the dismal public transit system in Nepal. More buses need to ply during rush hour and the
    buses must be made more comfortable (by using better cushions, air conditioning, better suspension, etc...).
    Punctuality and reliability of public transport systems must be upheld. Cleanliness and hygiene must be kept in mind
    while maintaining bus and train stations.
    <br>

    <br>
    The above approaches must be complemented with efforts to change the false notion the using public transport is
    contemptible. The best weapon to deal with this is to make public transport as dignified and pleasant as
    possible.

    Within the state of Arizona, Rob, along with his family, moves frequently from city to city. After his arrival, one
    of his first tasks was to find an apartment close to work, as he did not have a car. Usually, there are many
    different places to choose from, and he considers cost, location, and luxury. If one apartment has a washing machine
    and dryer and costs four hundred dollars a month, he prefers to rent it over another apartment which has
    significantly less rent and is located two blocks from a Laundromat. Rob's family never wanted to live in an
    apartment on the thirteenth floor, since all of them fear heights. He also tried to choose an apartment with a
    landlord recommended by former tenants. Everybody knows that it is important to find a responsible landlord. Rob and
    his wife love to cook together when both are free, so they need a spacious, well-equipped kitchen. Rob often looks
    for a place with an air conditioner because there are so many scorching days and nights in Arizona. Whenever Rob
    finds a new apartment, all of his concerns disappear. He felt relieved and called his mother. Someone
    understands!

    <h3>Project Work</h3>
    <br>
    <span>People have been using different technologies for a long to make their works easy. In our communities too,
        people used many traditional technologies which are no longer in practice. Meet some elderly people in your
        community and ask them about such technologies. Write a report and share it to the class.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Traditional Technologies Which Are No Longer In Practice In Nepal
    </p>
    <br>
    <b>Introduction</b>
    <br>
    This is the Report on the Traditional Technologies in Nepal carried out by Avisek Adhikari as a project work. The
    Report reviews the status of Science and Technology with specific goal to identify traditional technologies which
    are no longer in practice.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Objectives</b>
    <br>
    With the advent of democracy in 1950, Nepal opened up to the outside world. This opening also marked the beginning
    of activities in science and technology. This report is an attempt to present the traditional technologies which are
    no longer in practice in Nepal.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Methodology</b>
    <br>
    This report is mainly based on information shared by elder peoples of my community. I developed a questionnaire and
    circulated to various elderly peoples. Using this, I analyzed all the feedbacks and prepared this report.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Findings</b>
    <br>
    The history of science and technology and its development in Nepal is yet to be traced back and studied
    systematically. Historical events have recorded the use of some advanced scientific knowledge and the adoption of
    some innovative technologies in areas such as agriculture, civil engineering, architecture, metallurgy, water
    management, medicine, textiles, paper manufacture, dyeing and food technology.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some important traditional technologies of Nepal are as follows:
    <br>
    1. Iron Casting
    <br>
    2. Iron, Copper Refining
    <br>
    4. &lsquo;Dhusa&rsquo; salvaging gold dust
    <br>
    5. Nepali weaving machine
    <br>
    6. Lime technology
    <br>
    7. Ghatta water turbine
    <br>
    8. Hand grinder Janto
    <br>
    9. Lever grinder Dhiki
    <br>
    10. Percussim intruments
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Conclusion</b>
    <br>
    Studies have revealed that Nepal had good technical know-hows in metallurgy, architecture, agricultural input,
    organic dying, water management by mills and irrigation. Some of these technologies are still in use where modern
    technologies have not replaced them. The contribution of traditional technologies to the overall socio-economy has
    been significant even today. However, these technologies are not nurtured or improved.
