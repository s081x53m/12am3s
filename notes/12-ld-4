    <h3>Comprehension</h3>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>a. What is a hyperloop? How does it work?</span>
    <br>

    <br>
    Hyperloop is a planned train that would be capable of travelling at incredible speeds. It's superfast because it's
    enclosed in a tube with no air in it. As a result of the lack of air, there will be no friction to slow the train
    down.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>b. How is hyperloop more beneficial than the traditional trains?</span>
    <br>
    Hyperloop is much beneficial and superior than any traditional or a high-speed rail. It's less expensive and uses
    less energy since the track doesn't have to provide electricity to the pods constantly and because the pods may
    depart every 30 seconds, it's more like a demand-based service.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>c. Does hyperloop have a successful history? How?</span>
    <br>
    No, it does not have a successful history since the original concept for hyperloop was to use waggons and pneumatic
    tubes to transport mail and parcels between buildings.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>d. Write the contributions of Robert Goddard and Elon Musk for the development of hyperloop.</span>
    <br>
    In order to provide ultra-fast intercity transport, Space X and Tesla founder Elon Musk created the hyperloop idea.
    In addition to automobiles, aircraft, boats, and trains, Elon envisions a &quot;fifth mode&quot; of transportation
    that utilises travel pods housed within steel tubes. He revived interest in the idea of hyperloop in August 2013
    with his 'Hyperloop Alpha' paper.
    <br>

    <br>
    The 'vactrain' idea, created by Robert Goddard in the early 20th century, is clearly a prototype of the hyperloop.
    Since then, a slew of similar concepts have been proposed.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>e. What relation does speed have with air resistance? Explain.</span>
    <br>
    More Air resistance decreases the speed of a moving body and vice versa. Since, Hyperloop will travel through the
    vacuum tubes, the speed will drastically increase as the result of no-air resistance.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>f. What are hyperloop capsules compared with? How are they similar?</span>
    <br>
    Because both Hyperloop and Boeing 747 accelerate at the same measure of acceleration, Hyperloop capsules are likened
    to Boeing 747.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>g. How do the passengers feel while travelling via hyperloop? What will be done to make it luxurious?</span>
    <br>
    On a hyperloop, the passengers feel approximately the same as riding a lift or a passenger aircraft. The cabin shows
    beautiful scenery and each passenger has access to his or her own private amusement systems, to let them have a
    easeful travel.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>h. Why does the writer doubt about the success of hyperloop? What does the success depend on?</span>
    <br>
    Hyperloop's success will be determined on the destinations, the local economy, and the geographical location. The
    author has concerns regarding hyperloop's viability because of the enormous multibillion-dollar expenditure and the
    fact that the projects are still in the pilot and experimental phases. In the past, Nikola Tesla and Elon Musk had
    already closed the same concept program, due to no response from government authorities.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>
        a. Is the hyperloop the future of transportation or just a dream? What do you think? Justify your opinion with
        suitable reasons.
    </span>
    <br>

    <br>
    Basically, Hyperloop is a conceptual transport system in which passengers are loaded into pods and fired through
    vacuum tubes all at a supersonic speed. Hyperloop isn't just about speed; it also aims to be environmentally
    friendly.
    <br>
    The concept just like of Hyperloop is not new though. Pneumatic tubes for the parcel, mail, and money transfers
    found widespread acceptance in the 19th century and are still used at supermarkets, postal sorting stations, and
    banks today. Hyperloop's concept resembles the pneumatic mail delivery systems. Even flying on the air seemed to be
    impossible on past days but now travelling via air is common for us. So no one can say that it&rsquo;s not possible
    because everything which was a dream once, is reality now.
    <br>

    <br>
    In conclusion, we can see that Hyperloop may become the future of transportation systems worldwide. If this becomes
    a reality, even though it is not expected for decades, there will be an immense impact on ordinary people's lives.
    Apart from the convenience and the green impact, we can also hope for economic success.
    <br>

    <br>
    However, despite the immense promise, new technologies take time, and will be a while until we can travel in a pod
    inside a sealed tube with a sound only as loud as a gentle 'SWOOSH.'
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>
        b. The number of private vehicles is increasing day by day in Nepal beyond the capacity of our infrastructure. What do you think should be done to curb the ever-growing number of private vehicles? Discuss.
    </span>
    <br>

    <br>
    The number of private vehicles is increasing day by day in Nepal beyond the capacity of our infrastructure and is
    outpacing the country's infrastructure. The number of Nepalese who own personal cars is steadily increasing. Despite
    the fact that it eases their day to day life, its causing great environmental loses. Private vehicles should be
    prohibited since their widespread usage degrades the environment and increases emissions of hazardous gases that
    will create major problems in the future. To control this critical situation some safety measures had to be
    taken.
    <br>

    <br>
    The best approach is to discourage people from opting to buy cars. This can be effectively done by increasing toll
    fare for cars and by devising a system of progressive taxation on cars. The system can have an upper limit on the
    number of cars owned per family and the rate of tax on each car can be increased as the number of cars bought keep
    rising.
    <br>

    <br>
    But these efforts would be meaningless unless they are accompanied by measures to encourage people to use public
    transport by revamping the dismal public transit system in Nepal. More buses need to ply during rush hour and the
    buses must be made more comfortable (by using better cushions, air conditioning, better suspension, etc...).
    Punctuality and reliability of public transport systems must be upheld. Cleanliness and hygiene must be kept in mind
    while maintaining bus and train stations.
    <br>

    <br>
    The above approaches must be complemented with efforts to change the false notion the using public transport is
    contemptible. The best weapon to deal with this is to make public transport as dignified and pleasant as
    possible.

    <b>Corrected Passage:</b>
    <br>

    <br>
    Within the state of Arizona, Rob, along with his family, moves frequently from city to city. After his arrival, one
    of his first tasks was to find an apartment close to work, as he did not have a car. Usually, there are many
    different places to choose from, and he considers cost, location, and luxury. If one apartment has a washing machine
    and dryer and costs four hundred dollars a month, he prefers to rent it over another apartment which has
    significantly less rent and is located two blocks from a Laundromat. Rob's family never wanted to live in an
    apartment on the thirteenth floor, since all of them fear heights. He also tried to choose an apartment with a
    landlord recommended by former tenants. Everybody knows that it is important to find a responsible landlord. Rob and
    his wife love to cook together when both are free, so they need a spacious, well-equipped kitchen. Rob often looks
    for a place with an air conditioner because there are so many scorching days and nights in Arizona. Whenever Rob
    finds a new apartment, all of his concerns disappear. He felt relieved and called his mother. Someone
    understands!
