    <h3>Comprehension</h3>
    <br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>a. Why did Iqbal want to sleep in the afternoon?</span>
    <br>
    Iqbal wanted to sleep in the afternoon because he had spent the night sitting on his bedroll in a crowded
    third-class compartment of the train.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. How did people react with each other in the train?</span>
    <br>
    People reacted in a very loud way with each other in the train.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. Why did the book Iqbal was reading bring commotion in the compartment?</span>
    <br>
    The book Iqbal was reading brought commotion in the compartment because the book was an English book and the people
    thought that reading the book in the English language as wise, praiseworthy and prestigious.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. Why did Iqbal have to give clarification with his personal details?</span>
    <br>
    Iqbal had to give clarification with his personal details about his background because the travelers in the train
    thought him as an intellectual and wise person and therefore, they insisted him to reveal his personal details.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. Who was Meet Singh and what did he report to Iqbal?</span>
    <br>
    Meet Singh was a priest of Gurudwara and he reported to Iqbal about the murder of a fellow villager perhaps by a
    village's dacoit named Jugga.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>f. How according to Meet Singh, was Jugga Sing different from his forefathers?</span>
    <br>
    According to Meet Singh, Jugga Singh was different from his forefathers in the sense that his forefathers were also
    dacoits like him in the past. They never looted or harm their own village or its people. They used to keep the
    villagers safe from dacoits. But Jugga robbed the people of his own village and even killed the people of his
    villager. He killed one of the people of his village.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>g. How does the author show contradiction in Meet Singh's character?</span>
    <br>
    The author shows contradiction in Meet Singh's character by saying that Meet Singh was not bothered by Jugga's act
    of murdering fellow villager and as a priest of Gurudwara, he even wanted to swear on the holy Granth to defend
    Jugga from the crime of murder.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>h. Who was Hukum Chand and how did he succeed in his career?</span>
    <br>
    Hukum Chand was the Deputy Shahib, also known as Nar Adami. He succeeded in his career by pleasing his Shaibs and
    getting promotions one after.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. Iqbal is addressed as Babu Sahib by general folk simply because he knew English. Are Nepali people who can
        speak
        English taken with respect? Discuss the importance of learning English in the Nepali context.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Yes, Nepali people who can speak English are taken with respect. In Nepal, English is treated as a language of elite
    class. Most of the Nepalese think that English is closely associated with class and social status of a person. If
    you are fluent in English you'll be perceived as a very respectable person who has achieved great things in life.
    It's almost same as visiting a store wearing classy clothes and getting all the attention from the salespeople
    there. If you visit the same store with normal clothes, you are bound to get less attention. People often judge a
    book by its cover. For Nepalese, if the cover is in English they'll directly buy the book, not just judge it.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. Do you agree with Iqbal&rsquo;s comments on crime and punishment? In your view, what should the state,
        society
        and individuals do for peace and order in social lives?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Yes, I agree with Iqbal comments on crime and punishment. To cultivate and maintain a culture of peace, state,
    society and individuals ought to work together.
    <br>
    <br>
    Peace begins with the individual. We must realize that, as individuals, we are not powerless and that the power of
    one can make a difference. As individuals we must accept the responsibility to end the scourge of war and culminate
    a culture of peace. We must realize that peace is more than the absence of war. War is a drain on both human and
    financial resources and as history proves, is not an effective means of resolving conflict. Peace involves a process
    of individual and communal participation. It requires justice, equal rights and equal opportunities.
    <br>
    <br>
    Next, society plays a very important role in maintaining peace and order in social lives. In society, every family
    has to be united to make their society a fine and secure place to live in. There should be a formation of a special
    team in society who takes care of peace and order in society. This team has to perform its duty for peace and order
    management and determine the punishment to the criminals.
    <br>
    <br>
    The state also plays a very important and responsible role in maintaining peace and order in social lives. The state
    has to implement various rules and regulations for the sake of peace and order in social lives. It should focus
    attention on the security of social lives by minimizing the crime and violence from the state. The state must have
    strict rules against crime and criminals. It should have the proper management of punishment to the criminals too.
    <br>
    <br>
    These are the things the state, society and individuals should do for peace and order in social lives.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <br>
    <span>A. Meet Singh says Jugga a badmash. There can be such people in your locality, too. Write a paragraph
        describing him
        / her.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    I met a guy during my school days, initially he was so good to me. Later he turned out to be the most dishonest guy
    I have ever met. I used to share all tiny and big secrets of mine with him as we had become good friends in no time.
    As time passed, I found out that he was not worth that. He used to reveal all those things of mine with his stupid
    friends and misinterpret me. When I got to know that, I was completely broken and frustrated. But being strong, I
    forgave him, who didn&rsquo;t even sincerely apologize. I believe in &mdash; forget, forgive and move on and that is
    how we should deal with such people. But don&rsquo;t forget the lesson you learn from them.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>B. You may have travelled by bus or train. During your travel, you might have got different experiences. Write
        a letter to your friend describing about your unforgettable journey.</span>

    <br>
    Dear Pratik,
    <br>
    <br>
    Hope this letter of mine finds you in the best of health and spirit. My heart fills with joy to share with you about
    one of my experience of travelling in bus to my hometown Sankhuwasabha. I traveled in Manakamana Yatayat numbered
    Nine Hundred and Ten boarded at 05:30 AM on 10/10/2078 and reached the destination at 06:30 PM on the same day.
    <br>
    <br>
    The journey throughout was amazing and relaxing. The view from the windowpane while it feels like trees running far
    from us looks so relaxing and calming. Waterfalls going by our side, fresh air coming through the window also adds
    excitement to the journey. The ticket price was not much expensive and was reasonable. Meals expenses were included
    in the ticket pricing. I got the corner seat. People traveling along with me were so friendly that we played cards/
    ludo/ chess while traveling and the time passed very easily.
    <br>
    <br>
    I believe this is some experience everyone should have at least once in the whole lifetime. The time spent on the
    bus that day was very comforting and enjoyable. I will surely be making another trip plan in the coming days and
    will be asking you to join me. Till then, take care.
    <br>
