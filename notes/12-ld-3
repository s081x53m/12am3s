                <br>
                <br><br>
                <br>
                Critical thinking <br>
                <br>
                a. &quot;Every match is a new opportunity. Put its failure behind and start over again.&quot; Does this
                apply to the Italian football team when we analyse their performance from their failure to qualify for
                the World Cup Football to their victory in the European Championship in these four years? <br>
                <br>
                Ans: <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. When a team plays in a home ground, it gets a huge support from the audience in the stadium. Does
                this support them to win the match or the players may feel pressure to win and thus lose? What do you
                think?<br>
                <br>
                Ans: I think a team playing in the home ground gets huge support and confidence from their home fans but
                the teams from other places get huge disadvantages; according to their zone, climate, and fan follower.
                Many teams have been won Match on home ground. More than 100 teams won the match on the home ground.<br>
                <br>
                In team sports, the term home ground &ndash; also called home field describes the benefit that the home
                team is said to gain over the visiting team. This benefit has been attributed to psychological effects
                by the supporting fans on the competitors or referees. Also, the players are used to, playing on their
                home ground due to which they can easily play there, despite of the weather, pitch or ground condition.
                But the visiting teams suffer from changing time zones or climates, or from the rigors of travel; and in
                some sports, to specific rules that favor the home team directly or indirectly.<br>
                <br>
                According to my views, in Euro Cup 2020 England lost the final match against Italy due to their fear and
                lack of faith. They had not won any match after 1966 A.D so that they had less hope and got more
                pressure from the home ground fans. Therefore, getting a huge support from the audience in the stadium
                does both i.e., supports the team to win the match as well as the players may feel pressure to win and
                thus lose.<br>
