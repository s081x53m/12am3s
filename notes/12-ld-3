    <br>
    <span>e. State the contribution of Roberto Mancini to the Italian football.</span>
    <br>
    Less than four years ago, Italy fell to the lowest point in its footballing history with
    failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in six decades. They are now the best team in Europe and
    with a national record of 34 games unbeaten under Roberto Mancini. Mancini brought great confidence to the Italian
    football team and went all out to win the Euro 2020.
    <br><br>

    <br>
    <span>f. How does the Euro Cup final 2020 remind the audiences of the 2018 World Cup semifinals? How?</span>
    <br>
    The Euro Cup Final 2020 remind the audiences of the 2018 World Cup semifinals because England also
    scored early against Croatia then spent most of the game chasing its opponent&rsquo;s midfield before
    losing in extra time.
    <br><br>
    <br>
    <br><br>

    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br><br>

    <span>
        a. &quot;Every match is a new opportunity. Put its failure behind and start over again.&quot; Does this
        apply to the Italian football team when we analyse their performance from their failure to qualify for
        the World Cup Football to their victory in the European Championship in these four years?
    </span>
    <br><br>
    Yes, the statement &quot;Every match is a new opportunity. Put its failure behind and start over again&quot; applies
    to the Italian football team. Italy is constantly improving and investing more and more in the improvement of its
    football team. Despite having faced so many challenges, digesting so many defeats, we can say that they have
    continued to improve and now the football culture in Italy is second to none.
    <br><br>
    There is no place in the world where a typical technician is more qualified than another. Every casual Italian staff
    member is excellent in rehabilitation, strategy and organization. Wherever they go, they have a manager who can lead
    a top club to success. They have an upscale nightclub. Juventus has a rich history, well-organized organization and
    a management team that is able to bring out the best in every player they sign. Few clubs reach this level of
    competence, which should be the standard. Think of the three biggest clubs in Europe: Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and
    Manchester City.
    <br><br>
    In the last four years Italy has undergone radical changes under Mancini. The Azzurri won 4-2 on penalties after
    taking the lead with Federico Chiesa, but came back from a draw by Alvaro Morata, who scored 1-1 goals and needed
    added time before the Italians won by 4-2 on penalties. From this we can say that Italian football team constantly
    learned from their past games and hence qualified for the World Cup Football to their victory in the European
    Championship in these four years.

        b. When a team plays in a home ground, it gets a huge support from the audience in the stadium. Does
        this support them to win the match or the players may feel pressure to win and thus lose? What do you
        think?
    </span>
    <br><br>

    I think a team playing in the home ground gets huge support and confidence from their home fans but
    the teams from other places get huge disadvantages; according to their zone, climate, and fan follower.
    Many teams have been won Match on home ground. More than 100 teams won the match on the home ground.
    <br><br>

    In team sports, the term home ground &ndash; also called home field describes the benefit that the home
    team is said to gain over the visiting team. This benefit has been attributed to psychological effects
    by the supporting fans on the competitors or referees. Also, the players are used to, playing on their
    home ground due to which they can easily play there, despite of the weather, pitch or ground condition.
    But the visiting teams suffer from changing time zones or climates, or from the rigors of travel; and in
    some sports, to specific rules that favor the home team directly or indirectly.
    <br><br>

    According to my views, in Euro Cup 2020 England lost the final match against Italy due to their fear and
    lack of faith. They had not won any match after 1966 A.D so that they had less hope and got more
    pressure from the home ground fans. Therefore, getting a huge support from the audience in the stadium
    does both i.e., supports the team to win the match as well as the players may feel pressure to win and
    thus lose.

    <br><br>

    <span>A. The following passage does not have any punctuation marks. Punctuate it with appropriate punctuation
        marks.</span>
    <br><br>
    &#10140; A lot of people try to get away from home for a few days each year for a holiday. There are lots of things
    to choose from, and where you go depends on how much money you've got to spend. Ideas for holidays include relaxing
    on a beach, exploring cities, and skiing. One man wanted to go to Australia but thought he'd never have enough money
    to get there. He'd go to his brother’s caravan at the seaside instead. A young woman wanted to go clubbing in Ibiza

    <b>Excerpts from the Interview are as follows:</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>1. Take us through you childhood and initial cricketing days? What age did you start playing cricket?</span>
    <br>
    I used to play all the sports in my school, when women&rsquo;s cricket was first introduced in Nepal; I was just 13
    years old. My teacher encouraged me to take up cricket and train for the same at the time I was a 7th grader.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>2. Have you always been a sports fanatic and how did cricket happen? Did you play any other sport growing
        up?</span>
    <br>
    Yes, I am a complete sports fanatic. I was always involved in some or the other sport in my school days and so my
    teachers asked me to take up cricket as well and have a hand on it. Football has always been my game I believe and
    so I always dreamt of becoming a footballer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>3. When and how did you get into the national cricket team? Which year did you make your debut?</span>
    <br>
    My debut in the national team came in the year 2007. I started off playing cricket in my school days for the school
    team when I got selected for the regional team- Nepal Jung and then I also participated in Nepal&rsquo;s first ever
    women&rsquo;s cricket tournament where I emerged as the best bowler and eventually got selected for the national
    team.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>4. How was cricket back then in Nepal when you started playing it? Has it evolved over the years?</span>
    <br>
    When I started playing, it was a huge challenge. There were not any training centres, there was a lot of social
    pressure and there were rarely any girls who wished to take up cricket. But today, I can say that it is slowly
    evolving.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>5. What is the structure or pathway for any aspiring cricketer to play for the national team in Nepal?</span>
    <br>
    The structure goes like getting into the district team first and then the regional. Once they have played enough
    games and emerge as deserving players, they go on to get selected in the national team.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>6. Do we have sufficient cricket academies in Nepal? Where do most of the girls train in Nepal?</span>
    <br>
    I am residing in Kathmandu since the year 2008 so I know only about the academies that are here in Kathmandu. Here,
    girls enrol with the Kathmandu Cricket Training Center (KCTC) and Baluwatar Cricket Academy (BCA).
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>7. What do you enjoy more, batting or bowling and why?</span>
    <br>
    Being a batting all-rounder, I have always enjoyed batting more.
