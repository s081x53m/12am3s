    <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. Have you made your own precept after you read this lesson? What is it? Share it with your
        friends.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Precept is a rule or principle that we make to conduct our behavior on the accordance of that. I also had many
    precepts even before reading this lesson. The major precepts of my life are:
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Success is temporary but failure is permanent&quot;
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Always stay Positive&quot;
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Believe in Karma rather than fate&quot
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Anything that happens, happens for good&quot;
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        b. According to Josh Lanyon, &ldquo;If there was one life skill everyone on the planet needed, it was
        the ability to think with critical objectivity.&rdquo; Justify this statement with your logic.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Josh Lanyon's statement regarding critical objectivity somewhat reflects the core idea related to the development of
    human skills on this planet. He has presented the fact behind the skills of the people of this planet. Here, Josh
    has related life skills of people of this planet with critical objectivity. According to him, the need for life
    skills itself was the ability within people to think with critical objectivity.
    <br><br>
    People on this planet moved along with different life skills in their lives. From ancient times up to now, people
    have been doing development in the sector of skill development and invention. The development of people on this
    planet was possible due to their ability of critical objectivity which runs along with their life skills knowingly
    and unknowingly.
    <br><br>
    Critical objectivity always moves along with life skills. People have applied various life skills in their lives
    which means they can think with critical objectives. Behind all these life skills, the ability of thinking with
    critical objectivity always remain with them.

    Subject: Interesting class that I had
    <br>

    <br>
    Dear Shristi,
    <br>
    I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am doing pretty fine here. I am writing
    to you in order to share my experience of my English classes.
    <br>
    <br>
    Compared to any other classes I have taken during my school history, I feel that no other class could
    give me so many joys, knowledge and pleasures than the English class could do. I learned it quite good
    and, in every test, I got the best mark in the class. I learned not only a lot of Basic English
    knowledge in my middle school but also the personal characteristics which lead my interests along
    through my later education life.
    <br>
    <br>
    When I was in my middle school, it used to be a great thing when I know that there would be an English
    class tomorrow morning because I could enjoy another interesting 45 minutes during the class. Rather
    than other classes, like Science, Nepali or Mathematics, I established my English-relative
    interests&rsquo; group in social media, which give me a great benefit in my study in the university. I
    believe no other class can inspire me so far to pursue a scientific result.
    <br>
    <br>
    Another important thing I achieved through the English class is to collaborate with other students. I
    think it certainly formed my teamwork sprite when I entered the career position as an engineer. I can
    still clearly remember my English teachers of primary school and high school. They are all the people of
    great patient and instructive characteristic. They told me not to quit when I failed again and again.
    They give me a lot of confidence and disciplines of the mind toward success. Saying that English class
    is the only class that I used to enjoy most, I would like to end this mail.
    <br>

    <br>
    Regards,
    <br>
