                <br>
                Notes by: Subarna Poudel
                <br>
                <br>
                Working with words<br><br>
                A. Find the words from the text that match with the following meanings.<br>
                a. Shuffle &ndash; walking by dragging one's feet along or without lifting them fully from the
                ground<br>
                b. Doodle &ndash; drawing pictures or patterns while thinking about something else<br>
                c. Plaque &ndash; a piece of flat metal with writing on it<br>
                d. Precepts &ndash; a general rule intended to regulate behavior or thought<br>
                e. Sneaky &ndash; move or go in a furtive or stealthy way<br>
                <br><br>
                B. Consult your teacher and define the following thinking skills.<br>
                a. Convergent thinking<br>
                Convergent thinking is the type of thinking that focuses on coming up with the single, well-established
                answer to a problem. It is oriented toward deriving the single best, or most often correct answer to a
                question.<br>
                <br>
                b. Divergent thinking<br>
                Divergent thinking is a thought process or method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many
                possible solutions. Many possible solutions are explored in a short amount of time, and unexpected
                connections are drawn.<br>
                <br>
                c. Critical thinking<br>
                Critical thinking is the analysis of facts to form a judgment. The subject is complex, and several
                different definitions exist, which generally include the rational, skeptical, unbiased analysis, or
                evaluation of factual evidence.<br>
                <br>
                d. Creative thinking<br>
                Creativity is the ability to generate a thought or an idea that is completely new, appealing, and
                useful. Creative thinking is a skill that enables you to come up with original and unconventional
                ideas.<br>
                <br><br><br>
                Comprehension<br><br>
                Answer the following questions.<br>
                a. Who was Jack? How did he make children laugh?<br>
                Ans. Jack was a kind of kid other kids like and had a lot of friends. He made children laugh by saying
                jokes.<br>
                <br><br>
                b. Why are &ldquo;Sharks&rdquo; important to Reid?<br>
                Ans. Sharks are important to Reid because they keep ocean clean by eating dead organisms.<br>
                <br><br>
                c. What does Mr. Browne think about the most important thing?<br>
                Ans. Mr. Browne thinks that the most important thing is to know oneself, or own character's and evaluate
                them to bring the best version of someone.<br>
                <br><br>
                d. What is that has not been noticed by the student? <br>
                Ans. The thing that has not been noticed by the student is the message in the notice board of the school
                entrance gate that writes &ndash; &ldquo;Know Thyself&rdquo;.<br>
                <br><br>
                e. How did Jack make fun of the English class?<br>
                Ans. Jack made fun of the English class by saying that they were there to attend English class to the
                teacher's question &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo;.<br>
                <br><br>
                f. What were the students going to do at the end of the month?<br>
                Ans. The students were going to write an essay on the basis of the Brownie&rsquo;s percept at the end of
                the month.<br>
                <br><br>
                g. What particular act of students surprised a girl student?<br>
                Ans. Students used to come up with their very own personal precept, write it on a postcard, and mail it
                to Mr. Brownie after their graduation, this thing surprised the girl student.<br>
                <br><br><br>
                Critical Thinking<br><br>
                a. Have you made your own precept after you read this lesson? What is it? Share it with your
                friends.<br><br>
                Ans. Precept is a rule or principle that we make to conduct our behavior on the accordance of that. I
                also had many precepts even before reading this lesson. The major precepts of my life are: <br>
                &quot;Anything that happens, happens for good&quot;, <br>
                &quot;Always stay Positive&quot;, <br>
                &quot;Believe in Karma rather than fate&quot; <br>
                &quot;What we are today is the result the choices we made yesterday, so we have to make choices
                wisely&quot;<br><br>
                These are some of the precepts which I don't only think are ideal but also try to implement in my daily
                behavior.<br>
                <br><br><br>
                b. According to Josh Lanyon, &ldquo;If there was one life skill everyone on the planet needed, it was
                the ability to think with critical objectivity.&rdquo; Justify this statement with your logic.<br><br>
                Ans. Josh Lanyon has said this very finest quote which I personally liked very much. Creativity enables
                us to more freely and innovatively examine and resolve issues. It is self-directed, self-disciplined,
                self-monitored and self-corrective thinking. It includes the rational, skeptical, unbiased analysis,
                clarity, accuracy, consistency, factual evidence, good reason etc. Creative thinking involves thinking
                about an unusual topic. It helps to consider things from a fresh perspective and different angles. It is
                an inventive thought process that results in surprising conclusions. Creative thinking can be aided by
                brainstorming or lateral thinking to generate ideas. Creative thinking skills include problem-solving,
                writing, visual art, communication skills and open-mindedness A creative thinker tries to address an
                issue from a perspective that has not been used before. Thus, creative thinking is the thing that
                matters most of the time in human life.<br>

                Writing<br><br>
                Write an email to your friend explaining an interesting class you had.<br><br>
                Ans.<br>
                From: binodkumar12@gmail.com <br>
                To: shristi2011@gmail.com<br>
                Subject: Interesting class that I had<br>
                <br>
                Dear Shristi,<br>
                I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am doing pretty fine here. I am writing
                to you in order to share my experience of my English classes.<br><br>
                Compared to any other classes I have taken during my school history, I feel that no other class could
                give me so many joys, knowledge and pleasures than the English class could do. I learned it quite good
                and, in every test, I got the best mark in the class. I learned not only a lot of Basic English
                knowledge in my middle school but also the personal characteristics which lead my interests along
                through my later education life.<br><br>
                When I was in my middle school, it used to be a great thing when I know that there would be an English
                class tomorrow morning because I could enjoy another interesting 45 minutes during the class. Rather
                than other classes, like Science, Nepali or Mathematics, I established my English-relative
                interests&rsquo; group in social media, which give me a great benefit in my study in the university. I
                believe no other class can inspire me so far to pursue a scientific result.<br><br>
                Another important thing I achieved through the English class is to collaborate with other students. I
                think it certainly formed my teamwork sprite when I entered the career position as an engineer. I can
                still clearly remember my English teachers of primary school and high school. They are all the people of
                great patient and instructive characteristic. They told me not to quit when I failed again and again.
                They give me a lot of confidence and disciplines of the mind toward success. Saying that English class
                is the only class that I used to enjoy most, I would like to end this mail.<br>
                <br>
                Regards,<br>
                Binod Kumar<br>
