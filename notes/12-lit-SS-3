    <center>A Devoted Son</center>
    <br>
    <h3>Understanding the text <br></h3>
    <br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.<br></span>
    <br>
    <span>a. How did the morning papers bring an ambience of celebration to the Varma family? <br></span>
    &#10140; The morning papers showed the Medical Examination result of Varma's son, Rakesh who scored the
    highest rank in the country. This news brought an ambience of celebration in the Varma family as it was
    the matter of pride for the family.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. How did the community celebrate Rakesh&rsquo;s success?<br></span>
    &#10140; The community people celebrated Rakesh&rsquo;s success by visiting his little yellow house at
    the end of the road. There they congratulate Rakesh's parents on their son's remarkable success and
    congratulate Rakesh himself. The whole house and garden are quickly filled with the sights and sounds of
    a festival, with beautiful garlands, party clothes, and gifts everywhere to be seen.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. Why was Rakesh&rsquo;s success a special matter of discussion in the neighbourhood?<br></span>
    &#10140; Rakesh&rsquo;s success was a special matter of discussion in the neighbourhood because he had
    just finished top of the list in the country's medical school examinations. It's fair to say that no
    one's ever seen anything quite like it in his neighborhood and community. Indeed, Rakesh is the first in
    his family to receive an education. There seems little doubt that this level of education is quite an
    uncommon scenario among the neighboring families, too.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. How does the author make fun with the words &lsquo;America&rsquo; and &lsquo;the USA&rsquo;?<br></span>
    &#10140; The author makes fun with the words &quot;America&quot; and &quot;The USA&quot; by associating
    them with Varma&rsquo;s nature of dealing with the words as he considered &quot;the USA&quot; as more
    prestigious than &quot;America&quot;. He said that America is the term to be called by his ignorant
    neighbours.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. How does the author characterize Rakesh&rsquo;s wife?<br></span>
    &#10140; The author characterizes Rakesh&rsquo;s wife as an old fashioned, plump and uneducated girl.
    She was so placid, complaisant and lazy but too good-natured and pretty fat one.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>f. Describe how Rakesh rises in his career.<br></span>
    &#10140; Rakesh started his career as a doctor in the city hospital and quickly reached the top of
    administrative: organization and was made a director. Then, he opened his own private clinic, bought a
    car and became known not only as of the best but also the richest doctor in town.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>g. How does the author describe Rakesh&rsquo;s family background?<br></span>
    &#10140; According to the author, Rakesh&rsquo;s family was from a poor background and they were
    illiterate as well. His father worked for a kerosene vendor and his mother spent her life in the
    kitchen. Even his grandparents worked as vegetable vendors. His parents worked hard and sacrificed their
    life, time, money and everything they have for the higher education and medical college of his child,
    Rakesh.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>h. What is the impact of Rakesh&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s death on his father?<br></span>
    &#10140; Rakesh's father was stricken with grief by the death of his wife as well as his retirement. The
    old father very quickly went to pieces and fell so frequently with such mysterious disease named a
    peevish whim (sudden irritation in mind) that even his son could no longer make it out.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>i. What did Rakesh do to make his father&rsquo;s old age more comfortable?<br></span>
    &#10140; Rakesh brought his father his morning tea in the old man&rsquo;s favorite brass tumbler, and
    sat at the edge of his bed, comfortable and relaxed his father&rsquo;s night-shirt, and read out the
    morning news to him to make even more comfortable in his old age.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>j. Why did the old man try to bribe his grandchildren?<br></span>
    &#10140; The old man tried to bribe his grandchildren so that he could get a chance to eat Jalebis
    because his oily fried food and sweets were prohibited by his son.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>k. Are Mr. Varma&rsquo;s complaints about his diets reasonable? How?<br></span>
    &#10140; From the point of view of an old father, Mr. Varma's complaints about his diets may be
    reasonable to some extent. But in fact, Rakesh as a devoted and obedient son and by profession, a doctor
    is right in his performances and activities because he conducts such activities for the healthy and
    better life of his sick father.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Reference to the Context <br></h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. How did the Varma couple make sacrifices for their son&rsquo;s higher education?<br></span>
    &#10140; Varma couple were from a poor background and they were illiterate as well. His father worked
    for a kerosene dealer and his mother in the kitchen. Even his grandparents worked as vegetable vendors.
    His parents worked hard and sacrificed their life, time, money and everything they have for the higher
    education and medical college of his child, Rakesh.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        b. Mr. Varma suffers from diseases one after another after his wife&rsquo;s death. Would he have enjoyed
        better health if she had not died before him? Give reasons.<br>
    </span>
    &#10140; Mr. Varma suffered from diseases one after another his wife&rsquo;s death. I think all this
    happen to him due to his wife&rsquo;s death as it made him alone and scattered. He thought most of the
    time about his life partner which leads him stricken with grief. The old father very quickly went to
    pieces and felt ill. Thus, if she had not died before him, he would have enjoyed better health.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. Dr Rakesh is divided between a doctor and a son. As a son, he loves his father and worries about his
        weakening health but as a doctor, he is strict on his father&rsquo;s diet and medicine. In your view,
        what else could Rakesh have done to make his father&rsquo;s final years more comfortable?<br></span>
    &#10140; Dr Rakesh is divided between a doctor and a son. As a son, he loves his father and worries
    about his weakening health but as a doctor, he is strict on his father's diet and medicine. In my view,
    Rakesh could have been more polite and respectful in his behaviour with his father in the final years.
    He shouldn&rsquo;t have been so strict and miserable while regulating his father's diet and food. His
    loud-speaking made his father very troublesome and miserable. So, if he had spoke to his father politely
    and in respectful way, he could have made his father&rsquo;s final years more comfortable.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. What does the story say about the relationship between grandfather and grandchildren?<br></span>
    &#10140; Desai&rsquo;s story &ldquo;A Devoted Son&rdquo; shows loving companionship between grandfather
    and grandchildren. They have good bonding. But in the story, grandfather is attracted towards his
    grandchildren to get some sweets like &lsquo;Jalebis&rsquo; from them as his oily fried food, and sweets
    were prohibited by his son, Rakesh. For that reason, the relationship between grandfather and
    grandchildren was found to be innocent, tricky, trusty and bonding in the story.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. Do you call Rakesh a devoted son? Give reasons.<br></span>
    &#10140; Yes, I call Rakesh a devoted son. He is devoted to his parents. He does everything that is
    asked of him. He does well in school, achieves and succeeds in a profession that brings his parents
    pride and joy, marries a woman of their choosing, comes back to India when they ask, and tends to his
    father when he is a weakened state. He is devoted in the sense that he is able to put his own wishes
    aside for their betterment. The bond that he carries being their son does not dissipate as he gets
    older. In other words, he remains their son, even taking priority over as a husband or a father.<br>

        a. Write an essay on The Parents&rsquo; Ambition for their Children in Nepali Society. You must give at
        least five examples.<br>
    </span>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
        The Parents&rsquo; Ambition for their Children in Nepali Society
    </p>
    <br>
    Family refers to a wide network of extended relationships. Parents have great ambition for their
    children in Nepali Society. Most of the parents of the children are predetermined and preoccupied with
    the prejudices that their children to be the best person in the society such as the best doctor, the
    best engineer, the best teacher, and many more. Due to parents&rsquo; ambition for their children, some
    children work hard to achieve their destination and get succeed at the end.<br>
    <br>
    Parents are the facilitator and guides who can lead their children to the right path of success and help
    them to obtain achievement in life. Every parent wishes their child to become the brightest star in the
    group. In some cases, their pushing to their kids leads them to succeed and help them to be better in
    life. Sometimes, parent&rsquo;s determining the future of their children do not prove how good their
    parents are and it leads destruction of life as well. Thus, parents should listen to the voice and aim
    of their children as well for their better in future.<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, the duty of parents is to stay close to their children, spend time together, playing and
    relaxing which will provide them with a sense of security and build a positive bond for their
    future.<br>

        b. Medicines replace our diets in old age. What can be done to make old ageless less dependent on
        medicine?<br>
    </span>
    &#10140;
    It is true that Medicines replace our diets in old age. With age, the number of calories you
    need begins to decline. As we get older, the body becomes less efficient at absorbing some key
    nutrients. In addition, the ability to taste food declines, blunting appetite. Some foods become
    difficult to chew or digest. <br>
    <br>
    Thus, medicines become the best option in old age unless and until the person gets proper diet. To
    make old ageless less dependent on medicine, they should do the following things:
    <br><br>
    - Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables such as fruits like pineapples, oranges and vegetables such as
    carrots, pumpkin, and sweet potatoes.<br>
    <br>
    - Eat cereals, bread, crackers, rice or pasta every day mostly high fiber varieties.<br>
    <br>
    - Have low-fat or fat-free dairy (milk, or cheese) that are fortified with vitamin D to help keep your
    bones healthy.<br>
    <br>
    - Drink about 10-15 glasses of water a day to prevent dehydration especially in summer.<br>
    <br>
    - Exercise regularly, stretch and do yoga to ensure absorption of nutrients well.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>c. Write an essay on &ldquo;Care of Elderly Citizens&rdquo; in about 300 words.<br></span>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
        Care of Elderly Citizens
    </p>
    <br>
    Elderly citizens refer to old people who have crossed middle age. Old age is the final period of human
    life. During this time a person needs love and affection and proper elderly care. An old man doesn't
    have many requirements. He/she only need a little affection, care, and a homely environment to spend
    his/her final stage of life.<br>
    <br>
    Elderly people spend a major part of their lives in the building and shaping of our life and carrier,
    and thus it is our responsibility to repay them in their old age. Unfortunately, in today's world, some
    youth ignore their responsibility towards their parents. They are seen forgetting their moral duties
    towards elders. They aren&rsquo;t ready to understand the importance of elderly care and instead of
    caring for their parents during their old age, they prefer to send them to old age homes. They prefer to
    live an independent life rather than living with their parents. This is not a good sign for our society.
    Being social animals, we need to know how to take care of old people. They should know how to take care
    of their elderly parents.<br>
    <br>
    In fact, getting old is a natural process. During old age, people need utmost love and care. Caring for
    the elderly is not only a responsibility but also a moral duty. Old people are the backbone of a family.
    They are well experienced with the hardships of life. It is said that life teaches us lessons. Old
    people teach us how to grow, how to survive in this world and how to shape our carrier as well. They
    establish us in this world with their immense effort. It is our responsibility to pay them back during
    their old age.<br>
