    </span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. Since the world is now in 21st century, everything is gradually developing through traditional
    culture to modern culture. Nowadays, people want to satisfy their feeling. They change their behaviour
    to family lifestyle in modern societies. They want to live in nuclear family with the full of happiness
    with child, husband and wife but other side in there is rapid increase of divorce in Nepal due to
    misunderstand in nuclear family. In Nepali families both male and female can rule household, country.
    Everybody male and female is getting equal right in family. Every family member understanding each other
    felling, happy and they can share their idea, concept in family member. In Nepalese families young age
    at marriage in Nepal is closely linked to the widespread practice of arranged marriages, where
    relationships and agreements between families prevail over individual choices. Thus, a decline in very
    early marriage, accompanied by a decrease in the interval between marriage and cohabitation, may
    indicate a change in the marital decision-making process and an increase in the level of involvement on
    the part of spouses in the formation of their own marital unions. Thus, they will bring both positive
    and negative changes on the society.

    <br>
    <center>The Importance of Family</center>
    <br>
    In today’s world when everything is losing its meaning, we need to realize the importance of family more
    than ever. While the world is becoming more modern and advanced, the meaning of family and what stands
    for remains the same. It does not matter what kind of family one belongs to. It is all equal as long as
    there are caring and acceptance. You may be from a joint family, same-sex partner family, nuclear
    family, it is all the same. The relationships we have with our members make our family strong. We all
    have unique relations with each family member. In addition to other things, a family is the strongest
    unit in one’s life.
    <br><br>
    One cannot emphasize enough on the importance of family. They play a great role in our lives and make us
    better human beings. The one lucky enough to have a family often do not realize the value of a family.
    However, those who do not have families know their worth. A family is our source of strength. It teaches
    us what relationships mean. They help us create meaningful relationships in the outside world. The love
    we inherit from our families, we pass on to our independent relationships. Moreover, families teach us
    better communication. When we spend time with our families and love each other and communicate openly,
    we create a better future for us. When we stay connected with our families, we learn to connect better
    with the world. Similarly, families teach us patience. It gets tough sometimes to be patient with our
    family members. Yet we remain so out of love and respect. Thus, it teaches us patience to deal better
    with the world. Families boost our confidence and make us feel loved. They are the pillars of our
    strength who never fall instead keep us strong so we become better people.
    <br><br>
    As we know that society is important for family. Society is the combination of one or more family member
    so, without family society cannot create. A family makes us responsible for our duty toward society.
    Family provides social security in the society. Family introduces you in the society. In the social
    world without a family an individual's identity is never complete.
    And I think that family will change in future due to upgrading of modern technology, 5-10 year there is
    big
    family where very family member were residing but now day most of the family is living in nuclear family
    format.
    <br><br><br><br>
    <span>
        b. Some people think it is better to live in a nuclear family. Other people think that living in
        extended family is more advantageous. What do you think? Write an essay discussing the advantages and
        disadvantages of both.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    Ans.
    <br>
    In my views both the Extended family and Nuclear family are better at their own place as both of them have some
    advantages and some disadvantages.
    <br><br>
    Extended family is a combination of all generation
    of member. In these families, all member of the family including the children also grow with the belief
    that they also have certain duties and function to perform. They should learn to control their demand
    and expectation. In Nepal, more people prefer to stay in extended family and I'm also one of them in
    comparison to nuclear family. The advantage of extended family are, in extended family there is a good
    social and emotional relationship among the family members. There is a proper economic and social
    security. In extended family there is a proper care and supervision for the children also proper
    education and control over the problem of adolescence. The important advantage of extended family is a
    sense of protection of culture, tradition and values. There is not only advantage of Extended family but
    also some disadvantages occur in extended family. In extended it can push back in personality
    development. There is less privacy. There may be probability of low living standards. There may be
    difficult to meet needs and demand of each member in the family. Less of self confidence and dependency
    may increase in the extended family
    <br><br>
    Now talking about the nuclear family, Nuclear family is composed of husband, wife and their children, otherwise
    Extend family composed of grandfather, grandmother, parents, brother and their wives, daughter in-law, grandson
    etc., who share same kitchen and shelter up to four generation. Some of the advantages of nuclear family is that
    there is high understand and cooperation among each other, less possibility of quarrel among family member due the
    fewer members. It is easy to meet need and demand of each family.There is freedom of making decisions of their own.
    Also there are some disadvantages of having nuclear family as there is lack of security and confidence, there is
    lack of proper care of children and old age people.There is generation gap in respecting the norms and value of
    people. There is lack of love and care for the children if the couple engaged in professions.
    <br><br>
    Thus in short we can say that both the nuclear and extended family are better at their own place.
