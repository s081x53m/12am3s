    <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
    <br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. Why was Mrs. Baroda unhappy with the information about Gouvernail&rsquo;s visit to their
        farm?
    </span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. Mrs. Baroda was unhappy with the information about Gouvernail&rsquo;s visit to their farm because
    he was a man, she'd heard a lot about but had never met. Also, she had planned a period of rest and
    conversation with her husband, Gaston Baroda from their busy life throughout all winter which was
    canceled by the Gouvernail&rsquo;s visit to their farm.
    <br><br>
    <br>
    <span>b. How was Gouvernail different from Mrs. Baroda&rsquo;s expectation?</span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. Mrs. Baroda had never met Gouvernail in her life. Before meeting him, she pictured him
    unconsciously as slim, tall, cynical with eyeglasses and hands into his pockets. She didn't like him
    while picturing him. But, when she met him, she found him different from her expectation. She found him
    slim, neither tall nor cynical. At the very first sight, she found herself attracted to him. Also, one
    night when she had a conversation with him on her estate, her detestation for him turned into a desire
    to establish a relationship with him. Thus, Gouvernail was found to be totally different from Mrs.
    Baroda&rsquo;s expectation.
    <br><br>
    <br>
    <span>c. How does Mrs. Baroda compare Gouvernail with her husband?</span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. Mrs. Baroda finds Gouvernail less sociable compared to her husband. Although. she finds Gouvernail
    attractive, but she does not perceive the same traits in him as her husband. She couldn't find any of
    the brilliant and promising qualities that Gaston, her husband, had often informed her he possessed in
    him. Despite his courtesy, Mrs. Baroda considers him unsociable in comparison to her husband because he
    does not appear to be paying attention to her.
    <br><br>
    <br>
    <span>d. Why and how did Mrs. Baroda try to change Gouvernail&rsquo;s solitary habits?</span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. Mrs. Baroda tried to change Gouvernail's solitary habits because she didn't expect a commotion over
    his presence and he was no more interested in facts. Mrs. Baroda became quite tried to find her guest
    uninterested. She didn't even find any reaction within him when she showed her rude manner of leaving
    him alone with her husband at first. She tried to change Gouvernail's solitary habits because she wanted
    him to be more demanding and interesting. For that, she started accompanying him in his idle walks up to
    the mills and assured him to be more talkative and adaptable to the situation.
    <br><br>
    <br>
    <span>e. How does Gaston disagree with his wife on Gouvernail&rsquo;s character?</span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. Gaston disagrees with his wife on Gouvernail's character saying that Gouvernail doesn't expect
    commotion over his presence. According to him, Gouvernail needs a break from his busy life which is full
    of works. Against his wife's opinions, he supports Gouvernail's character saying that he has all the
    positive traits like friendliness, frankness, talkativeness and social nature.
    <br><br>
    <br>
    <span>f. Why is Gaston surprised with his wife&rsquo;s expression towards the end of the story?</span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. Gaston is surprised by his wife's expression towards the end of the story because his wife's
    expression was quite puzzling enough for him to understand. She states that she has overcome everything
    and she will be nice to him on his next visit. Her strange statement in delighting tone makes Gaston
    feel surprised.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <br>
    <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
    <br><br>
    <span>
        a. What is the cause of conflict in Mrs. Baroda&rsquo;s mind? What role does Mrs. Baroda &lsquo;being a
        respectable woman&rsquo; play in the story?
    </span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. The cause of conflict in Mrs. Baroda's mind is her attraction towards her husband's friend
    Gouvernail. She finds herself attracted to him at very first sight. She is puzzled in her act of liking
    a person like Gouvernail. Mrs. Baroda 'being a respectable woman' plays a very vital role to control her
    desires and prevent her from doing immoral acts. Her self-dignity of being a respectable woman and wife
    makes her aware of her social reputation and the limitations of social norms and values.
    <br><br>
    <br>
    <span>b. Sketch the character of Gouvernail and contrast it with Gaston.</span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. Gouvernail is one of the major characters of this short story &quot;A Respectable Woman&quot; by
    Kate Chopin. He has played the role of a visitor who has come to spend his one or two weeks in Mr.
    Gatson Baroda's sugar plantation in Louisiana. He has visited Baroda&rsquo;s' plantation to spend his
    time and take a rest from his tiresome busy life. He presents himself quite simply and in a courteous
    manner in response to Baroda's welcome and hospitality. He likes to live a peaceful life without any
    disturbance. He is not interested in fishing and hunting. Gouvernail is seen breaking his silence at the
    end of the story while sitting on a bench just beside her. He remains in Baroda's house as a simple
    guest and his reserved nature creates a bit of tension between Mr. Gaston and Mrs. Baroda.
    <br><br>
    On the other hand, Mr. Gatson Baroda seems quite sociable, frank and friendly. He is a quite caring
    husband. He loves and trusts his wife so much. He is a wealthy sugar planter and often has positive
    thinking. He doesn't feel good to hear his wife disliking opinions about Gouvernail. He tries his best
    to persuade his wife about Gouvernail. He is a brilliant man with a hobby of fishing and hunting. He
    nicely treats his guests and provides them good hospitality. Thus, both Mr. Gaston and Gouvernail are
    seen quite different in the story.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <span>c. Why does Mrs. Baroda not disclose her feelings towards Gouvernail to her husband?</span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. Mrs. Baroda doesn't disclose her feelings towards Gouvernail to her husband because she wants to
    handle the situation herself by being sensible. She feels much disturbed and puzzled due to Gouvernail's
    reserved nature. She is troubled by her inner conflict. She wants to reveal her great folly of last
    night to her husband at first. But later on, she desires to tackle her problem herself. As a respectable
    woman or a wife, she thinks that being human, some battles of life should be handled alone.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <span>
        d. The last three sentences of the story bring a kind of twist. After reading these three sentences, how
        do you analyze Mrs. Baroda&rsquo;s attitude towards Gouvernail?
    </span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. Kate Chopin's writings always direct her readers towards brilliant and ambiguous closings. She
    often created twists in her creations at last. The last three sentences of Mrs. Baroda create a kind of
    confusion for all the readers. After reading her statements, I think she will treat Gouvernail more
    nicely the next time but being a respectable woman or a wife. She will surely overcome the folly of her
    first experience. She will present herself as a perfect host without expecting such desires as
    before.

    <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
    <br><br>
    <span>
        a. The entry of an outsider into a family has been a recurring subject in both literature and films.
        Narrate a story real or imaginative where an outsider&rsquo;s arrival destroys the intimate relationship
        between the husband and the wife and causes break up in marital relationship without direct fault of
        anyone. Anton&rsquo;s Chekhov&rsquo;s story &lsquo;About Love&rsquo; is a story on this subject.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. The story of &quot;About Love&quot; has been written by a Russian writer Anton Chekhov. &quot;About
    Love&quot; is a story about love affairs. Here in this story, the third love story somewhat reflects the
    same ideas as seen in the story of Kate Chopin's &quot;A Respectable Woman&quot;.
    <br><br>
    The third story has presented the love story of the major character Alyohin and Anna, the wife of
    Dimitry Luganovich.
    <br><br>
    When Alyohin is elected for honorary justice of the peace, he has to go to town for work. There he meets
    another judge whose name is Dimitry Luganovich. Once he goes to the house of Luganovich to have dinner.
    There he meets Anna Luganovich, the wife of Dimitry Luganovich. The beauty, youth and intelligence of
    Anna attract him. Alyohin&rsquo;s mind is disturbed by Anna&rsquo;s memory. He starts meeting with her.
    They pass time together for hours. They share gifts. They go to the theatre and also share their joys
    and sorrows. Alyohin falls in love with her, but his morals and thoughts stop him to express his love
    openly. As a result, Anna suffers from mental tiredness. Both of them suffer a lot due to middle-class
    moralities. But later on, Alyohin sees the illusion that Anna enjoys her life and doesn&rsquo;t pay
    attention to him. Due to their relationship, Anna suffers from mental tiredness. Finally, the Luganovich
    family has to move. Alyohin goes to say goodbye to Anna inside the train. When their eyes meet for the
    last time, both cry and hug each other. Alyohin kisses Anna and expresses his deep love. Finally, both
    separate from each other because Anna is leaving for Creamea for her treatment.

    <span>
        b. Mrs. Baroda makes an expectation about Gouvernail even before meeting him. Suppose you are a mature
        girl/boy and your family members are giving you pressure for getting married. Write in about 200 words
        describing what qualities you would like to get in your future husband/wife.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. Marriage is a sacred relationship between two people. It is a union of two or more people that
    creates a family tie and carries legal, social or religious rights and responsibilities. Before
    marriage, we need to think as well as know about the person with whom we are going to get married. It is
    a lifelong relationship that's why we have to choose a perfect life partner.
    <br><br>
    If I get pressure from my family members for getting married, I would like to have the following
    qualities in my future wife.
    <br><br>
    1. Lovable and caring: My future wife must be lovable and caring. She must be lovable and caring for all
    my family members.
