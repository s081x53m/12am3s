    <br><br>
    <br>
    <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
    <br><br>
    <span>
        a. What is the cause of conflict in Mrs. Baroda&rsquo;s mind? What role does Mrs. Baroda &lsquo;being a
        respectable woman&rsquo; play in the story?
    </span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. The cause of conflict in Mrs. Baroda's mind is her attraction towards Gouvernail and the fear of society. Being a respectable woman Mrs. Baroda controls her feeling and let the social norms win. She was so attracted to her husband’s friend Gouvernail, she wanted to touch his face, lips with her sensitive fingers but she doesn't do that and controls herself being a respectable woman.
    <br><br>
    <br>
    <span>b. Sketch the character of Gouvernail and contrast it with Gaston.</span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. Gouvernail is the Mr. Baroda’s college friend who came to spend a week or two in his friends’ sugar plantation. Gouvernail is a slim and attractive man. He doesn't wear eyeglasses and he is so lovable and inoffensive. He is a silent guy and loves peace. He neither frank nor too chatty. He loves to sit on portico and enjoy the cool air with cigar. He accepts what Baroda couple gives and doesn't demand anything. Some characters of Mrs. Baroda and his friend Gouvernail are just opposite. Mr. Baroda is so frank and chatty but Gouvernail is too silent. Gouvernail smokes but Mr. Baroda does not. It can be said that Mr. Baroda is extrovert and more sociable man whether in contrast Gouvernail is introvert and less sociable man.

    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <span>c. Why does Mrs. Baroda not disclose her feelings towards Gouvernail to her husband?</span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. There are some battles in life which a human being must fight alone. Mrs. Baroda was a respectable woman and if she discloses her feelings towards Gouvernail to her husband, it may cause a serious problem. A husband never likes his wife being attracted to another man. Many husbands have given divorce to their wives after knowing that they are attracted towards other man. Moreover, if she reveals her feelings the friendship of Mr. Baroda and Gouvernail may weaken. That's why Mrs. Baroda does not disclose her feelings towards Gouvernail to her husband.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <span>
        d. The last three sentences of the story bring a kind of twist. After reading these three sentences, how
        do you analyze Mrs. Baroda&rsquo;s attitude towards Gouvernail?
    </span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. The last three sentences of the story bring a kind of twist. Mrs. Baroda liked Gouvernail but due to the fear of society and fear of loss of her respect she didn't want Gouvernail to come in their house. But last she proposed, wholly from herself, to have Gouvernail visit them again. She said to her husband, "I have overcome everything! You will see. This time I shall be very nice to him". After reading this I think Mrs. Baroda has overcome the fear of society. And now, she will not control herself and will flow with her emotion. I think she will do everything what her heart wants to do with Gouvernail as she has said that she will be nice to him. In another point of view, we can say that she has overcome her feelings and emotions towards Gouvernail and will be normal to him.

        between the husband and the wife and causes break up in marital relationship without direct fault of
        anyone. Anton&rsquo;s Chekhov&rsquo;s story &lsquo;About Love&rsquo; is a story on this subject.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    Ans. The story of &quot;About Love&quot; has been written by a Russian writer Anton Chekhov. &quot;About
    Love&quot; is a story about love affairs. Here in this story, the third love story somewhat reflects the
    same ideas as seen in the story of Kate Chopin's &quot;A Respectable Woman&quot;.

    another judge whose name is Dimitry Luganovich. Once he goes to the house of Luganovich to have dinner.
    There he meets Anna Luganovich, the wife of Dimitry Luganovich. The beauty, youth and intelligence of
    Anna attract him. Alyohin&rsquo;s mind is disturbed by Anna&rsquo;s memory. He starts meeting with her.
    They pass time together for hours. They share gifts. They go to the theatre and also share their joys
    and sorrows. Alyohin falls in love with her, but his morals and thoughts stop him to express his love
    openly. As a result, Anna suffers from mental tiredness. Both of them suffer a lot due to middle-class
    moralities. But later on, Alyohin sees the illusion that Anna enjoys her life and doesn&rsquo;t pay
    attention to him. Due to their relationship, Anna suffers from mental tiredness. Finally, the Luganovich
    family has to move. Alyohin goes to say goodbye to Anna inside the train. When their eyes meet for the

        girl/boy and your family members are giving you pressure for getting married. Write in about 200 words
        describing what qualities you would like to get in your future husband/wife.
