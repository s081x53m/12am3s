    <center>A Matter of Husbands</center>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <br>
    'A Matter of Husbands' by Ferenc Molnar is a very twisted one act. It depicts the story of an Ernest Woman who is
    married to a lawyer who knows of a Famous Woman. The Ernest Woman comes to the Famous Woman because she believes
    that her husband is cheating on her with the Famous Woman. The famous woman weaves a tale about how it is a cleverly
    staged act where the man is attempting to trick his wife to get more affection from her. When the Famous Woman
    finally convinces the Ernest Woman that the story is true we find out that the husband was hiding in the closet the
    whole time.
    <br>
    <br>
    This play would require only two female actresses. Our group has many strong comedic female actresses that could
    make these parts very over dramatic. The relationship between the two will need to grow and both of the performers
    will need to be very comfortable with each other. I don&rsquo;t think either of the characters in this one act are
    particularly likable. The actor playing the Ernest Woman would need to be very ditzy and gullible and the Famous
    Woman would have to be very wicked and twisted.
    <br>
    <br>
    This one act somewhat of a set; nothing too flashy but still enough to create a mildly realistic setting. Lighting
    would be very basic and standard. I think that blocking could add a lot to this piece and add another layer of
    comedic humor to the piece. As for costuming, I see the Famous Woman wearing a floor length gown with matching
    gloves and a fur coat and the Ernest Woman wearing a frumpy dress with white shoes with the socks sticking out. I
    think that the costuming will help introduce the characters before they even begin speaking. With a one act there is
    not a lot of time for character development so any way to help reveal something about the characters is a necessary.

    <br>
    <span>g. Write down the plot of the play in a paragraph.</span>
    <br>
    A Matter of Husbands is a one-act written by most celebrated and controversial play wright Ferenc Molnar. This play
    sheds light on the role of actors on the stage and in real life and how much they are capable of keeping us in an
    illusion.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the beginning, the Earnest Young Woman rushes to the Famous Actress angrily, asking her to return her husband.
    The famous Actress boldly denies, that she has stolen her husband. She says she knows him because once the contract
    for a case has given to him. Earnest Young Woman tells her that her husband sends her flowers and writes love
    letter. She reads her husband's love letter for the actress.
    <br>
    <br>

    gain her love back. Then, the Earnest Young woman innocently realizes her misdeed and begs sorry with her. Earnest

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. Sketch the character of Famous Actress.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Famous Actress is a young, renowned, and beautiful actress who is envied by the ordinary woman. On the outside,
    she looks innocent and harmless but in reality, she is mean and wicked. She is cunning and deceitful as seen in the
    way she concocts a story to sway the woman from believing that her husband was having an affair with her. She also
    lives an immoral life as seen in the conclusion of the story where it was revealed that Alfred, the ordinary woman's
    husband was actually in her house.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. Shed light on the difference between an ordinary woman and an actress.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    In the story, &quot;A Matter of Husband&quot;, the ordinary woman is portrayed as a simple-minded and timid person
    who was easily deceived by the false story told by the actress. She had come to the actress in tears completely sure
    that her husband was having an affair with the actress. However, the actress told a story to her of how her husband
    was trying to regain the love he had for her by doing things to get her jealous. Without asking questions, the
    ordinary woman believed her and bought into the story. In the end, it was revealed that her husband was actually in
    the actress's room. This shows that the actress was cunning while the ordinary woman was timid.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. According to Famous Actress, men associated with theatre use the theatre actresses to make their estranged wives
    jealous so as to woo them back. Do you agree with her argument? Why? Why not?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Yes I agree with her argument. A men associated with theatre mostly have an ordinary, simple-minded and timid wife
    who can be easily deceived by the false story. In the act too, Alfred was hiding in the actress&rsquo;s room so as
    to regain the love he had for her by doing things to get her jealous. Thus, men take advantage of the cunning
    actress to make their estranged wives jealous so as to woo them back.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. How does Famous Actress make a fool of Earnest Young Woman?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Famous Actress makes a fool of Earnest Young Woman by saying that a misunderstanding may have arrived between her
    and her husband. She makes Earnest Young Woman believe that her husband has been playing with her to make her
    jealous and gain her love back. Then, the Earnest Young woman innocently realizes her misdeed and begs sorry with
    her.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        e. The conversation between the two women takes place on the stage of the theatre. What role does the theatre house
        as a part of setting play in A Matter for Husband?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    The scene is a drawing room and the design and colorings are exotic and suggestive of the apartment of the famous
    Hungarian actress in which this dialogue takes place. When the curtain rises the Earnest Young Woman is discovered,
    poised nervously on the edge of a gilt chair. It is plain she has been sitting there a long time. For perhaps the
    fiftieth time she is studying the furnishings of the room and regarding the curtained door with a glance that would
    be impatient if it were not so palpably frightened. At last the Famous Actress enters through the curtained door at
    the right which leads to her boudoir.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>f. What do you think about the ending of the play?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    The ending of this play &lsquo;A Matter of Husbands&rsquo; is totally perfect. And it is quiet justify the ending of
    the play .The writer does the ending of this play is very pertness. He finishes all the nonplus of the character of
    the play. All the characters are satisfied to one another. The film actress and advocate are very satisfied in the
    end of the play. They clear the hurdle between them. They ensure to her that they have no affair it is only drama
    for you. In the end of the play the young woman is very happy about her husband. The film actress and the husband of
    young woman live together without any obstacle. The ending of the play is too good but full of irony. The film
    actress narrates to young woman that her husband really loves her but in reality he has no love for his wife. He
    only cheats his wife.
    <br>
    <br>
    So, end of the play &lsquo;A Matter of Husbands&rsquo;, we can assume that &ldquo;All is well the end is
    well.&rdquo; Innocent people always suffer by shrewd people because they are often sincere by hearts but the cunning
    people always take advantage by their innocence.

    <br>
    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">My Favorite Actor</p>
    <br>
    I like Johnny Depp, an American actor known for his portrayals of unique characters, such as Captain Jack Sparrow in
    &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.&rdquo; With the film&rsquo;s success, it revealed new
    doors and nominations for his career. The film also opened a new door for me. Since the film Johnny Depp has become
    my favorite actor. I admire Depp as an actor because of his talent, generosity, and devotion. Johnny Depp is one of
    the most talent actors I&rsquo;ve seen. He is perhaps one of the most versatile actors of his day and age in
    Hollywood. Not only is he extremely talented, but he is also a generous man. He is part of several charitable
    causes. He supports Make A Wish Foundation, and donates frequent packages to the children. Johnny Depp is also a
    devoted person. He is exceedingly devoted to his family. His favorite activity is to be home playing with the
    children. There aren&rsquo;t many actors like Johnny Depp, and I admire him even more for standing out against the
    rest. He is a gifted actor, kindhearted, and a devoted person. Johnny Depp is my favorite actor, and I admire him
    not only as an actor but as a person.
