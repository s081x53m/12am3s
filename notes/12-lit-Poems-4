        <h3>Reference to the context </h3>
        <br>
        <span>a. What does the poet mean by &lsquo;the awakening age&rsquo;? </span>
        <br>
        As the word glorifies itself, 'the awakening age' refers to the period when Africans realize and become
        conscious about their situation as well as the time to create their new world. They realise that this is the
        time of peace, harmony, integrity, liberty, happiness, prosperity, unity and creativity amongst the people. They
        strongly believe that their new world will arrive after Nigeria's brutal civil war.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>b. Why, in your view, have these people &lsquo;lived with poverty&rsquo;s rage&rsquo;?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        In my view, these people have 'lived with poverty's rage because since a long time before history Africans are
        being exploited by the Americans and Europeans. They did a long injustice to the people of Africa and exploited
        natural resources. Also meanwhile, due to lengthy war in African countries, the political stability was almost
        negligible. As a result of instability, a few strong people gained control of the authority. This further
        resulted in an imbalance in the distribution of natural resources and wealth.
        <br>
        <br>
        The people of Africa were beyond knowledge and light. They didn't even know that life exists out of poverty.
        They were also preoccupied with various internal problems like civil war, discrimination, religion, culture,
        ethnicity, philosophy and so on which neglected the suffering of ordinary Nigerians. Thus the poverty's rage had
        been all their life.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>c. Why does the poet appeal for solidarity among the people? </span>
        <br>
        The poet appeals for solidarity among the people to make a reality out of their hope to form a new world for
        them. He wishes for all Nigeria's unfortunate and poor people to reach the new height of unity, prosperity,
        hope, truth, wisdom, liberty and creativity. He strongly believes that solidarity only and only amongst them can
        help them to overcome challenges and sufferings.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>d. Does the poet present migration in a positive light? Why? Why not?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Yes, the poet presents migration in a positive light as it helps the people to change their perceptions. Mostly
        the migrants are of the working-age population. Migration helps people to raise their height of acceptance and
        helps to grow their condition to the new state from the past one.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the poem also, the poet wishes for them to be unified, smart, prosperous and creative in the new age of
        awakening and appeals for solidarity to create a new world. Most of us have seen that migrants bring skill with
        them. Some bring capital and some bring creativity. They try to craft their ideas, knowledge and learning in
        recipient countries. They also wish to be innovative and contribute.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>e. Nepal is also known for its economic as well as educational migrants. Have you noticed any change in
            the perceptions and behaviours of these migrants when they return home from abroad? </span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Yes, Nepal is known for its economic and educational migrants. The data each year people pursue abroad for
        education and employment. Certainly, I have noticed many changes in the perceptions and behaviours of these
        migrants when they return home. I have noticed the change in their attitude and way of thinking. As a person
        opens in a wide space from the narrow door, he experiences many things, explores many heights, learns, thinks,
        crafts and thus the way of thinking and way of seeing the world is certainly changed. Every worker or student
        brings their gained knowledge and tries to use it in their homeland. If either it is capital gain or a degree
        they try to craft from them. They gain financial literacy and learn to invest and keep the hope of changing
        traditional thoughts and parameters that limits the exploration. These are the different perceptions that I have
        seen of people returning from abroad in my community.

        <span>f. Relate the rhyme scheme of this sonnet to the kind of life idealized by the poet.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        The rhyme scheme of this sonnet is sonorous and is of AA BB CC DD EE FF GG. It can be said that it is the poetry
        of optimism and hope. The poet is trying to show the idealized existence of Africans, especially Nigerians, in
        the new world of awakening with the assistance of the poem's rhyme pattern. All of the lines and rhyming phrases
        after couplets are linked with the lives of Nigerians and their ideal way of life. This includes realization,
        hope and solidarity. He also wishes for wisdom, liberty, knowledge and joy. His excellent rhyming scheme
        synchronizes with the ideal existence of Nigerians in the world of the awakening age.
