    <center>A Day</center>
    <br>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <br>
    The poem begins with the speaker narrating to us readers how the sun rises. The persona refers to the sun&rsquo;s
    rays as &ldquo;ribbons&rdquo;. The layering of these &ldquo;ribbons&rdquo; is a gradual process. But the
    significance of the eventual sunrise isn&rsquo;t lost on the world. &ldquo;The news&#8230;&rdquo; of this phenomenon
    travels fast.
    <br>

    <br>
    The eagerness of the child speaker to talk about sunrise portrays his/her innocent view of the world. This persona
    cares for the seemingly insignificant things, thus telling readers it&rsquo;s okay to pause and appreciate the
    &ldquo;normal&rdquo; changes in nature. Like the sunrise. In a metaphorical sense, this stanza also hints at the
    excitement stemming from the beginning of life (childbirth).
    <br>

    <br>
    The second stanza describes the events which occur due to sunrise. The sun illuminates the top of
    &ldquo;Hills&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bobolinks&rdquo; (a species of blackbirds) begins to sing. This stanza highlights
    similarly natural occurrences that seem to respond to the sun rising. It once again focuses on the beauty of nature
    around us, thus encouraging readers to be more appreciative of them.
    <br>

    <br>
    In the third stanza, the subject matter drifts from sunrise to sunset, and the speaker&rsquo;s tone from excited to
    reserved. The child&rsquo;s confidence wanes since he/she doesn&rsquo;t know much about sunset. Yet, the persona
    describes the little they can, more sober than excited.
    <br>

    <br>
    In the final stanza of &lsquo;A Day&lsquo;, Emily Dickinson&rsquo;s faith comes to light. This dominantly symbolic
    stanza uses Christian references like &ldquo;flock&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dominie in gray&rdquo; to show the poet&rsquo;s
    own view about death. Where a &ldquo;Dominie in gray&rdquo; means &ldquo;God&rdquo;, and &ldquo;flock&rdquo; means
    human beings, Dickinson believes God leads human beings wherever after they die.

    <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
    <br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>a. How does the poet describe the morning sun in the first stanza?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; In the first stanza the poet describe the morning sun as a sign of happiness. For her, it seemed like the
    church steeples are &quot;swimming in Amethyst&quot; as the multicoloured rays of sun drift over the water. She also
    says that that the gloomy darkness begins to change colour as soon as the sun's brilliant fire emerges. As a result,
    the appearance of the sun spreads rapidly, like the pace of squirrels and makes everything bright and visible.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>b. What does the line &lsquo;The news like squirrels ran&rsquo; mean?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The news to which Emily Dickinson refers as &lsquo;The news like squirrels ran&rsquo; is the dawning of a
    new day. News travels fast, as they say, and it's no different here. In fact, the news of the sun rising travels
    even faster than most kinds of news for the simple reason that everyone can see the dawn with their own eyes. The
    speed at which everyone receives this news is likened to the running of a squirrel. The comparison is particularly
    apt given that the squirrel, like the sun, is part of the natural world.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>c. What do you understand by the line &lsquo;The hills untied their bonnets&rsquo;?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Bonnets refers to a special type of hat which can be tied under the chin. Before sunrise, the hills seem
    darker and gloomier as they were wearing a bonnet. But as soon as the sun emerges and the sun rays fall on hills,
    all hills appear lovely in excellent green colour. Hence, the above phrase means that the hills seem to be unveiling
    their greenery and beauty by removing their bonnets, after the sunrise.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>d. Is the speaker watching the morning sun? Why? Why not?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Yes, the speaker is watching the rising sun. The speaker is observing the change in colour of the steeple
    into amethyst, untied bonnets of the hills. He is also listening to the singing of the beautiful bobolinks and all
    these events confirm that the speaker is watching the morning sun.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>e. How does the sun set?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Actually, the speaker is really unknown to the sunset. All he knows is that the sun goes away taking all
    the happiness, joy and leaves the unhappy and gloomy dark when it sets. The slowly turning purple and yellow hues
    signal the sun's setting. As he is unclear about the setting sun, he doesn't know how exactly the sun set.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>a. What, according to the speaker, is a day?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; According to the speaker a day is just like human life where sun rise is the birth, and setting of the sun
    is compared with death. Here the poet depicts the beauty of life and the uncertainty of death in a philosophical
    sense.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>b. What purpose does the hyphen in the first line serve in the poem?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; A hyphen (-) is a punctual mark used in writings to join works or parts of words. In poetry, a hyphen is
    used to show pause. Emily Dickenson uses punctuation marks in her poem in an innovative way. She uses hyphens if she
    doesn't find the suitable words to express deep emotions, to granting readers to imagine and complete the missing
    words and to show the power of silence in front of certain situations. It is also used to give a sudden emphasis.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>c. What makes this poem lyrical and sonorous? Discuss.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The poem &quot;A Day&quot; by Emily Dickenson is both a lyrical and sonorous poem. The poem is lyrical in
    the sense that it expresses personal feelings or emotions in the first-person narration. The first pronoun
    &quot;I&quot; used in lyrical poems indicates the poetic persona. This poem is very short and the poetess is
    expressing her personal experience of observing sunrise. The word &quot;Sonorous&quot; means full of sound and rich
    in verse or language. Several things make a poem musical and melodious. Sound devices alliteration, assonance, rhyme
    and rhythm make a poem musical.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>d. Who are the target audience of the speaker? Why?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; In the poem, the world is seen through the eyes of an innocent child. Speaker is telling her friends,
    &quot;I will tell you how the sun rose&quot;. So, we may argue that the intended audience consists of kids who have
    lost the opportunity to see the sun rising when they wake up late at night. When we look at the poem from a
    philosophical point of view, the whole human race is also the intended audience. Sunrise is the beginning of life,
    daytime activities are a trip through life, and sundown is the end of life. However, the final result is a little
    mysterious.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>
        e. The poem seems to describe a day for children. How would the adult people respond to this poem? Discuss this
        poem
        with your parents/guardians and write the answer based on their responses.
    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The poem &quot;A Day&quot; is a literal description of the dawn, as well as the events that occur between
    sunrise and sundown. To be more precise, the poem speaks about the passage from life to death in a philosophical
    sense. There is enthusiasm at the beginning of life, a squirrel racing like a life and a strange conclusion to a
    life in this poem.

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>a. Observe your surroundings of one fine morning and write a poem based on your own experience.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140;
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">My Surroundings</p>
    <br>
    I look at my surroundings,
    <br>
    The paintings and pictures,
    <br>
    Some are good some are bad,
    <br>
    Some are happy and some are sad,
    <br>
    They are doing sports or dancing,
    <br>
    Others are kissing or singing,
    <br>
    I wish I could be one of those happy people again,
    <br>
    Singing and dancing every day,
    <br>
    But I find myself depressed and deceived,
    <br>
    I long to have a perfect life.

    <span>b. Write a personal essay on A Day in the School.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140;
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">A Day in the School</p>
    <br>
    Everyone loves school life and mostly the beautiful events which one experiences in a school. People develop a sense
    of emotional and social connection with the school. The school teaches us so many life lessons and values.
    <br>

    <br>
    But, there comes a day when we all need to part away from our school and our friends. It is difficult for anyone to
    leave the school one day and forever. When I recall my last day at school, I become very emotional. It was a moment
    of painful separation.
    <br>

    <br>
    That day it felt like we had a really short journey together that it passed so fast. Some of my friends became too
    emotional that tears started rolling down their cheeks. There was a small gathering arranged in our school hall.
    <br>

    <br>
    Our juniors welcomed us to the hall which was decorated for us. Everyone gathered to bid us goodbye and to wish us
    for a better future. Our juniors gave speeches. Some of them sang and danced for us. They also asked us to give
    speeches. Some of my friends and I went to the stage and performed a group song. I also gave a speech on how we
    spent our school days there.
    <br>

    <br>
    Our teachers came to us and started consoling us. They tried to inspire us with motivational words. Our headmaster
    praised us for being disciplined and honest in school. She also advised us to maintain the same wherever we go. All
    other teachers encouraged us and told us to do hard work in life because it would help us to be successful in life.
    <br>

    <br>
    The day was a mixture of sadness and happiness. I felt happy I was going to a new school. I was sad because I was
    leaving my teachers and was parting from our dearest friends. It was a hard day for every one of us. This is how I
    experienced my last day at school.
