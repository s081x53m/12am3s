    <br>
    APJ (Avul Pakir Jainulabdeeni) Abdul Kalam is a well-known aerospace scientist of India. He became a famous
    aerospace scientist because he was inspired and motivated by the explanation of the flight dynamics of birds
    practically given by his teacher Sivasubramania lyer in his school. There is the great associations of his childhood
    days in shaping his career. He was a keen student of mathematics and always scored full marks in it. He also scored
    full marks in Science in his study time. Beside this he would take extra classes of mathematics at his
    teacher&rsquo;s home. He kept himself always busy in solving complex number problems. The most impressing thing to
    him was the practical lecture of his teacher Sivasubramania lyer. He, along with his friends, was taken to the
    seashore of Rameswaram to have a practical demonstration on flight dynamics of the birds. The real teaching of his
    teacher had left him an influential remarks. He learnt how birds could fly using their wings and tails in a proper
    balance. When he learnt flight systems of the birds he was determined to study flight dynamics and following every
    steps suggested by his teacher, and hence he became an aerospace scientist.

    <br>
    <br>
    In his memoir, he mentions a sad event of religious discrimination in his school. His new teacher showed his
    discriminating behaviour when he saw a Muslim boy (Abdul) and a Hindu boy (Rameswaram) sitting together in a same
    bench in the classroom. Rameswaram Sastry was an intimate friend of him belonging to Hindu community. Abdul was
    ignorant about the religious discrimination between Hindu and Muslim. During the time, there was extreme religious
    discrimination between Hindu and Muslim. The behaviour of the new teacher was a true picture of the then society. He
    could not digest the friendship between a Hindu boy and a Muslim boy, so he forbaded Abdul to sit close to his
    Brahmin friend. Abdul was totally upset by this behaviour. By this incident, Abdul wants to show the picture of the
    society that was parted between two sects - Hindu and Muslim. Few people denied such divisions, but most of the
    people, including educated people believed in partition.

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <br>
    <span>Write a short autobiography featuring your childhood life using the following guidelines.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    I was born in a small village of north - eastern part of Nepalgunj District. I&rsquo;m from a middle class family.
    There are five members in my family including me. First of my respected Father who is tailor, then my lovely mother
    she is House wife. Other my family members are a eldest brother and a younger sister and both of them are studying
    too.
    <br>
    <br>
    Since I&rsquo;m a student, my daily routine focuses on studying and classes. I usually wake up at 6:00 am and do my
    daily routines like brushing my teeth, taking a shower and getting ready for class. After which I check my notes and
    revise for the day. My classes usually used to start by 8:00 am and ends by 1:00 pm. I used to attend classes
    regularly. After classes, I hang out with my friends for a while and go back home. I reach home and then usually
    take a nap till 4:30 pm. After taking a nap, I go out and play. I usually come back by 6 and have a bath. After
    which I get ready to study and by 9:00, I go to the bed.
    <br>
    <br>
    I used to play a lot with my siblings. I remember very fondly the games we use to play. Especially, in the evenings,
    we used to go out in the park with our sports equipment. Each day we played different games, for example, football
    on one day and cricket on the other. These memories of playing in the park are very dear to me. Most importantly, I
    remember this instance very clearly when we went out for a picnic with my family. We paid a visit to the zoo and had
    an incredible day. My mother packed delectable dishes which we ate in the zoo. My father clicked so many pictures
    that day. When I look at these pictures, the memory is so clear, it seems like it happened just yesterday. Thus, my
    childhood memories are very dear to me and make me smile when I feel low.
