    <h3>Understanding the text<br></h3>
    <br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.<br></span>
    <span>a. Describe how the young couple&rsquo;s house looked like.</span>
<br><br>
    Ans. The young couple's house was small, but it had the feel of an elegant cottage thanks to its high
    ceilings and paned windows. The young man could see out over the rooftops from his study window and used
    car yards the Moreton Bay figs in the park where they walked their dog.<br>
    
<br><br>
    <span>b. How did the young couple identify their neighbours in the beginning of their arrival?</span>
<br><br>
    Ans. When the young couple arrived for the first time, they had a negative impression of their
    neighbours. Many things irritated them. The cries and shouts of their neighbours came first, followed by
    the toddler urinating in the street and peering at the fence. In addition, the young man despised the
    neighbours' involvement with their gardening efforts. Their neighbours were also concerned about their
    dog, raised eyebrows when they awoke late, and disapproved of the young man being at home while his wife
    worked outside.
<br><br>
    <br>
    <span>c. How did the neighbours help the young couple in the kitchen garden?</span>
<br><br>
    Ans. The neighbours helped the young couple to remove the trash from their backyard and ploughed and
    manured the soil in the autumn. They planted leeks, onions, cabbage, brussels sprouts, and broad beans,
    prompting neighbours to approach the fence and provide suggestions for spacing, hilling, and mulching.
    The young man was annoyed by the interruption, but he listened carefully to what was said. Also, the big
    woman with the butcher's arms handed her a bag of garlic cloves to plant. In this way, the neighbours
    helped the young couple in the kitchen garden.<br>
    
<br><br>
    <span>d. Why were the people in the neighborhood surprised at the role of the young man and his wife in their family?</span>
<br><br>
    Ans. The people in the neighborhood were surprised at the role of the young man and his wife in their
    family because the young man stayed at home to write his thesis and his wife worked out which was new
    for the neighbours.<br>
    
<br><br>
    <span>e. How did the neighbours respond to the woman&rsquo;s pregnancy? </span>
<br><br>
    Ans. The neighbours responded to the woman&rsquo;s pregnancy by smiling tirelessly. The man in the deli
    gave her small presents of chocolates and him packets of cigarettes. In the summer, Italian women began
    to offer names. Greek women stopped the young woman in the street, pulled her skirt up and felt her
    belly, telling her it was bound to be a boy. By late summer the woman next door had knitted the baby a
    suit, complete with booties and beanie and the Polish widower next door had almost finished his two-car
    garage.
<br><br>
    <br>
    <span>f. Why did the young man begin to weep at the end of the story?</span>
<br><br>
    Ans. The young man began to weep at the end of the story because his neighbours were looking them with
    bleary faces and cheering the couples while his wife was giving birth. Thus, their love and care for his
    family made him weep.<br>
    
<br><br>
    <span>g. Why do you think the author did not characterize the persons in the story with proper names?</span>
<br><br>
    Ans. In village areas, the people are known by their appearance, work etc. rather than name. So, I think
    the author did not characterize the persons by proper names to make the story more realistic.
<br><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
<br><br>
    <span>
        a. The story shows that linguistic and cultural barriers do not create any obstacle in human
        relationship. Cite some examples from the story where the neighbours have transcended such
        barriers.
    </span>
<br><br>
    Ans. The story shows that linguistic and cultural barriers do not create any obstacle in human
    relationship. Some examples where the neighbours have transcended such barriers are as follows:
<br><br>
    1. In spite of the different languages and cultures, the neighbours gave advice to the young couple
    about spacing, hilling and mulching the vegetables in the kitchen garden.
<br><br>
    2. The polish widower rebuilt the falling henhouse of the young couple although they didn&rsquo;t
    understand his words.
<br><br>
    3. The young couple offered heads of cabbage and took gifts of grapes and firewood from
    neighbours.
<br><br>
    4. The neighbours gifted chocolates, knitted the baby a suit when the couples were going to be
    paren7s.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        b. The last sentence of the story reads &ldquo;The twentieth-century novel had not prepared him for
        this.&rdquo; In your view, what differences did the young man find between twentieth-century novels and human relations?
    </span>
<br><br>
    Ans. In my view, the major differences the young man found between the twentieth-century novels and
    human relations are that, unlike characters in novels, humans have to deal with and overcome a variety
    of unpredictable and startling situations throughout their lives. Everything does not go as well in real
    life as it does in the novel. To overcome these situations, one must prepare himself in ways that novels
    cannot teach.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        c. A Nepali proverb says &ldquo;Neighbors are companions for wedding procession as well as for funeral
        procession.&rdquo; Does this proverb apply in the story? Justify.
    </span>
<br><br>
    Ans. Yes, the proverb &ldquo;Neighbors are companions for wedding procession as well as for funeral
    procession&rdquo; applies in the story. In the story the neighbours helped the young couple a lot
    although their language, culture was totally different. Initially their relationship was not good but
    slowly they started sharing love, compassion and helping one another in needs. The excitement of the
    young woman's pregnancy was shared by everyone in the neighbourhood. Thus, this story shows that
    neighbours are companions for wedding procession as well as for funeral procession.
<br><br>
    <br>
    <span>
        d. The author has dealt with an issue of multiculturalism in the story. Why do you think
        multiculturalism has become a major issue in the present world?
    </span>
<br><br>
    Ans. Multiculturalism refers to the presence of diverse cultures in a community. It is mainly applied to
    the demographic make-up of a certain place, sometimes at the organizational level, such as schools,
    businesses, neighbourhoods, cities, or nations, as a descriptive phrase.
<br><br>
    I think multiculturalism has become a major issue in the present world because along with making people
    of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds together, it invites various social problems such as
    failure to assimilate, ethnic segregation, and adaptation issues such as school dropout, unemployment,
    and high crime rates etc. Also, migration is another reason for multiculturalism. People travel across
    different places of different countries and they settle in any place where they get proper facilities
    and job due to which multicultural peoples are found in same city or region. Due to this many peoples in
    neighbourhood don&rsquo;t know each other and the relation, love, compassion between the neighbours
    found in the past days are not found in the present days. In this way, multiculturalism has become a
    major issue in the present world.<br>

    <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
<br><br>
    <span>a. Write an essay on Celebration of Childbirth in my Community.</span>
<br><br>
    Ans. Childbirth celebration is the ceremony or ritual to celebrate the birth of a child with joy and
    happiness. Various communities have various rituals and traditions to celebrate childbirth. However, in
    my community, people use to gather at the home of the childbirth and congratulate their parents and
    family members. They also celebrate this auspicious occasion by singing, dancing and eating delicious
    foods.
<br><br>
    Every year, the birth of a child is celebrated with all pomp and show by the community and friends. To
    make the birth of a child a memorable and happy occasion, they would cook different food delicacies and
    offer them to the elders who are considered as the custodian of our tradition. They also arrange small
    gifts and give them to the babies mother and families.
<br><br>
    Mothers are treated with a lot of respect and love during their childbirth. They are given the best care
    during this period. When a mother is ready to give birth to the child, she would light up
    &lsquo;diyo&rsquo; and let it flow on the river to ward off evil spirits. They would even do
    &quot;antihuman sacrifices&quot; to make sure that the child is protected. This is a tradition to ensure
    the wellbeing of the child.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        b. Do the people in your community respond with similar reactions upon the pregnancy and childbirth as
        depicted in the story? Give a couple of examples.
    </span>
<br><br>
    Ans. Yes, the people in my community also respond with similar reactions upon the pregnancy and
    childbirth as depicted in the story. After knowing about a woman's pregnancy in the community, community
    members (especially women) will visit her at her home and spend time discussing the mother's condition.
    They also give the woman advice on how to look after her own health as well as the health of her child
    during this time.<br>
    People in my neighbourhood also shower gifts, chocolates, and clothing on the families of pregnant
    women. They also come up with a lot of names for the unborn child, both male and female.<br>
