    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. How does the author make satire on the modern idea of the &lsquo;self&rsquo; based on individuality, independence
        and uniqueness?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    The author in this essay satires on the modern idea of 'self&rsquo; based on individuality, independence and
    uniqueness. This essay is about the self and what nature can teach us. In the beginning the writer brings an
    attention to the trend in humans on uplifting the feeling of self-based on individuality, independence and
    uniqueness.
    <br>
    <br>
    Here the author is presenting the close relationship between the nudibranch and medusa living in the Bay of Naples.
    A mature jellyfish engulfs a tiny newly-hatched slug only to be devoured bit by bit until the snail dominates and
    the jellyfish is reduced to a round &quot;successfully edited parasite&quot; affixed to the skin near the snail's
    mouth. Finally the tentacles, until the jellyfish becomes reduced in substance by being eaten while the snail grows
    correspondingly in size.
    <br>
    <br>
    This essay projects both creatures cannot live in any other way, they depend for their survival on each other. The
    author illustrates the value of co-existence, cooperation, helpfulness, collaboration and togetherness with the tale
    of the nudibranch and the medusa. We all are important and one&rsquo;s life is determined by another like the
    relation between anemones and crabs as well as medusa and snail. It also shows the significance of friendship and
    dependence on each other for survival and existence. Through this, the author justifies that the modern people's
    pride over the concept of individuality, independence and uniqueness is not applicable in the real and practical
    life.

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <br>
    <span>A. Write an essay on &ldquo;Independence vs. Interdependence&rdquo; in about 250 words.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Independence vs. Interdependence</p>
    <br>
    Human beings usually categorize themselves into individual or group entities. These self-conceptions usually emanate
    in people&rsquo;s minds and determine their motivation as well as cognitions. There are usually two perceptions that
    people have about themselves regarding their relationship with others. The first is the independent self-concept
    where an individual&rsquo;s conception about his or her existence is that he or she exists separate from other
    people. Independent self-concept encompasses behaviour traits, preferences and attitudes of an individual. The
    second perception is the interdependent self-concept where a person is affiliated or feels connected to others. This
    paper explores the advantages of interdependence as opposed to independence. Gish Jen argues that &ldquo;the joy of
    a functioning interdependent relationship can be tremendous.&rdquo;
    <br>
    <br>
    Unlike independent-self which focuses on individual responsibility separate from the entire society, interdependent
    self-concept emphasizes shared responsibilities. The main tenet of interdependence self-concept is the reliance that
    exists among individuals in the society for survival and mutual development. Interdependence self-instils the idea
    that people are not alone in their attempts at mental growth and development. People also provided support for one
    another to grow socially. Interdependent self-concept also promotes responsibility sharing by encouraging
    individuals to take various roles, which contribute to the development and growth of the society.
    <br>
    <br>
    Interdependent self-concept is also crucial for overcoming fear. Unlike independence, which puts an individual
    against the rest of other members of the society, interdependence promotes cohesion among society members, thus
    helping individuals to experience lower levels of fear and insecurity. The recognition of the fact that one has
    support of others remains crucial for alleviating negative feelings, which could yield fear in individuals. Support
    for each other is only possible in a society where people feel close to each other and the society is characterized
    by high level of interdependence.
    <br>
    <br>
    Interdependence emphasizes on how people relate with each other and get on well with existing norms of the society,
    which dictate how people relate. Intrinsic attributes of individuals play no major role in the way individuals
    think, feel or act. However, Jen also argues that &ldquo;we need both the interdependent and the independent
    self,&rdquo; appealing that people from either side of self-concepts accommodates and understands each other.

    <h3>B. Write a newspaper article highlighting the increasing individualism in the modern Nepali society.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Increasing Individualism in the Modern<br>Nepali Society</p>
    <br>
    <b>
        By Ramesh Thapa
        <br>
        March 12, 2019
    </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Individualism is the moral stance, political philosophy, ideology and social outlook that emphasizes the intrinsic
    worth of the individual. Individualists promote the exercise of one's goals and desires and to value independence
    and self-reliance and advocate that interests of the individual should achieve precedence over the state or a social
    group while opposing external interference upon one's own interests by society or institutions such as the
    government. Individualism is often defined in contrast to totalitarianism, collectivism and more corporate social
    forms.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the modern Nepalese society, individualism is increasing rapidly. This increase appears to be due mostly to
    increasing socio-economic development, including higher incomes, more education, urbanization, and a shift toward
    white-collar jobs. Increases in these factors in a given region are reliably followed by gains in individualist
    beliefs and practices in the ensuing decade Nepal comes under those few countries that bucked the global trend
    toward individualism.
    <br>
    <br>
    Rising prosperity and education are largely welcome changes that reflect not merely gains in wealth for the
    already-wealthy, but for the desperately poor as well. Wealth, and the individualism that follows, are often
    conflated with selfishness. This is, in part, because individualism's inverse &mdash; collectivism &mdash;
    emphasizes close social ties and an interconnected rather than independent view of the self.
