    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. The writer seems to believe that rural life is better than urban life. Do you agree with him?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Yes, I agree with the writer that rural life is better than urban life. First and foremost, the tranquil
    surroundings and environment attracts me a lot. The village is always described as a quiet and peaceful paradise,
    which is a perfect place to unwind and escape from the rat-race and Hustle and bustle of the city life. Besides, the
    rural areas are less crowded because there are not many people and cars. The scenery in a village is beautiful as
    the beauty of nature is still well-conserved. Thus, people who live in the village can enjoy nature and have a
    peaceful mind.
    <br>
    <br>
    This condition is completely different with the city dwellers, who lead a hectic life and often feel annoyed due to
    great stress in their daily life. The environment in the rural area is less polluted. The air in the village is
    fresh and clean as there are plenty of undeveloped areas and greenery. In the rural area, there is less air
    pollution since there are not many factories and cars around. Living in the city may have its benefits such as
    better facilities and education. However, I am still in the opinion that living in the rural area brings more
    advantages than living in the city.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <span>b. Is the writer&rsquo;s way of looking at Bandipur just a gaze of an urban tourist? Why? Why not?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    No, the writer's way of looking at Bandipur is not just a gaze of an urban tourist. He doesn't visit Bandipur just
    as an urban tourist. Being fed with his hectic life in Kathmandu, he visit there along with his friends to feel the
    peaceful environment and amazing beauty of the place by his heart.
    <br>
    <br>
    Bandipur is a hilltop settlement and a rural Municipality which lies in Tanahu district of Nepal. This place is the
    centre of attraction for various reasons. The true and original beauty of the place attracts most of the tourists to
    this place. The amazing beauty and scenario of Bandipur also attracted the writer. At Bandipur, he and his friends
    are amazed by the local cultures, behaviours and organic and delicious food items. He enjoys various places in
    Bandipur along with his friends. He feels himself heartily connected to this place where he gets all sorts of
    refreshments which he has been looking for. He learns about places, people and their tourism businesses. The writer
    spends his best time in Bandipur. Thus, his gaze towards this beautiful place is more than an urban tourist.
