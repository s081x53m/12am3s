                Critical Thinking<br>
                a. What changes have started to occur in Nepali families in recent days? What impacts will they bring on
                the society? Discuss.<br><br>
                Ans. Since the world is now in 21st century, everything is gradually developing through traditional
                culture to modern culture. Nowadays, people want to satisfy their feeling. They change their behaviour
                to family lifestyle in modern societies. They want to live in nuclear family with the full of happiness
                with child, husband and wife but other side in there is rapid increase of divorce in Nepal due to
                misunderstand in nuclear family. In Nepali families both male and female can rule household, country.
                Everybody male and female is getting equal right in family. Every family member understanding each other
                felling, happy and they can share their idea, concept in family member. In Nepalese families young age
                at marriage in Nepal is closely linked to the widespread practice of arranged marriages, where
                relationships and agreements between families prevail over individual choices. Thus, a decline in very
                early marriage, accompanied by a decrease in the interval between marriage and cohabitation, may
                indicate a change in the marital decision-making process and an increase in the level of involvement on
                the part of spouses in the formation of their own marital unions. Thus, they will bring both positive
                and negative changes on the society.
                <br><br><br><br>
                b. We see many elderly people in the elderly homes these days in Nepal. Some of them are abandoned while
                others live there willingly. Do you think Nepali people are deviating from their traditional culture?
                Give reasons.<br><br>
                Ans.
                <br><br><br><br>
                Writing<br>
                a. Write an essay on The Importance of Family. In your essay, you can use these guided questions.<br>
                &bull; Why family is important to you.<br>
                &bull; Why family is or is not important for society<br>
                &bull; How you think families will change in the future.<br><br>
                Ans.<br>
                <center>The Importance of Family</center><br>
                In today’s world when everything is losing its meaning, we need to realize the importance of family more
                than ever. While the world is becoming more modern and advanced, the meaning of family and what stands
                for remains the same. It does not matter what kind of family one belongs to. It is all equal as long as
                there are caring and acceptance. You may be from a joint family, same-sex partner family, nuclear
                family, it is all the same. The relationships we have with our members make our family strong. We all
                have unique relations with each family member. In addition to other things, a family is the strongest
                unit in one’s life.
                <br><br>
                One cannot emphasize enough on the importance of family. They play a great role in our lives and make us
                better human beings. The one lucky enough to have a family often do not realize the value of a family.
                However, those who do not have families know their worth. A family is our source of strength. It teaches
                us what relationships mean. They help us create meaningful relationships in the outside world. The love
                we inherit from our families, we pass on to our independent relationships. Moreover, families teach us
                better communication. When we spend time with our families and love each other and communicate openly,
                we create a better future for us. When we stay connected with our families, we learn to connect better
                with the world. Similarly, families teach us patience. It gets tough sometimes to be patient with our
                family members. Yet we remain so out of love and respect. Thus, it teaches us patience to deal better
                with the world. Families boost our confidence and make us feel loved. They are the pillars of our
                strength who never fall instead keep us strong so we become better people.
                <br><br>
                As we know that society is important for family. Society is the combination of one or more family member
                so, without family society cannot create. A family makes us responsible for our duty toward society.
                Family provides social security in the society. Family introduces you in the society. In the social
                world without a family an individual's identity is never complete.
                And I think that family will change in future due to upgrading of modern technology, 5-10 year there is
                big
                family where very family member were residing but now day most of the family is living in nuclear family
                format.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. Some people think it is better to live in a nuclear family. Other people think that living in
                extended family is more advantageous. What do you think? Write an essay discussing the advantages and
                disadvantages of both.<br><br>
                Ans. <br>
                In my views both the Extended family and Nuclear family are better at their own place as both of them have some advantages and some disadvantages.
                <br><br>
                Extended family is a combination of all generation
                of member. In these families, all member of the family including the children also grow with the belief
                that they also have certain duties and function to perform. They should learn to control their demand
                and expectation. In Nepal, more people prefer to stay in extended family and I'm also one of them in
                comparison to nuclear family. The advantage of extended family are, in extended family there is a good
                social and emotional relationship among the family members. There is a proper economic and social
                security. In extended family there is a proper care and supervision for the children also proper
                education and control over the problem of adolescence. The important advantage of extended family is a
                sense of protection of culture, tradition and values. There is not only advantage of Extended family but
                also some disadvantages occur in extended family. In extended it can push back in personality
                development. There is less privacy. There may be probability of low living standards. There may be
                difficult to meet needs and demand of each member in the family. Less of self confidence and dependency
                may increase in the extended family
                <br><br>
                Now talking about the nuclear family, Nuclear family is composed of husband, wife and their children, otherwise Extend family composed of grandfather, grandmother, parents, brother and their wives, daughter in-law, grandson etc., who share same kitchen and shelter up to four generation. Some of the advantages of nuclear family is that there is high understand and cooperation among each other, less possibility of quarrel among family member due the fewer members. It is easy to meet need and demand of each family.There is freedom of making decisions of their own.
                Also there are some disadvantages of having nuclear family as there is lack of security and confidence, there is lack of proper care of children and old age people.There is generation gap in respecting the norms and value of people. There is lack of love and care for the children if the couple engaged in professions.
                <br><br>
                Thus in short we can say that both the nuclear and extended family are better at their own place.
