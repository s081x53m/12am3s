    <br>
    According to the author, it is heredity or environment that shapes a man&rsquo;s character. The birth of every child
    is
    same. By birth, a child is neither a liar, nor a rapist. He/she is not born full of hatred or violence. No one is
    born
    in any less glory or goodness that us. Hence heredity doesn't shape a man's character. It is our surrounding
    environment
    that shapes out character.
    <br><br>
    <span>h. Why is forgiveness important in our life?</span>
    <br>
    Forgiveness is important in our life because it is the way of freeing ourselves from our past errors and moving
    forward
    into our future unaffected by the mistakes we made in the past.
    <br><br><br><br>

    <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. Desmond Tutu once said, &quot;Forgiving is not forgetting; it is actually remembering-remembering and not using
        your
        right to hit back. It's a second chance for a new beginning.&quot; Does this quotation apply to this text? Analyze.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Forgiving is not forgetting; it is actually remembering-remembering and not using your right to hit back. It's
    a
    second chance for a new beginning.&quot; is one of the famous quotes of Desmond Tutu. Forgiveness is the way to
    release
    feelings of vengeance toward a person or group who harmed us, not matter they deserve forgiveness or not. It is not
    to
    deny seriousness of an offense against us or it doesn't mean forgetting. Here in the text, even if the author is
    willing
    to apologize, he is still a victim of his father&rsquo;s domestic violence. Desmond Tutu remembers the pain his
    father
    had given to his mother. He wanted to hurt back his father in his childhood. But later he forgives his father
    justifying
    that his father's rude behavior was because of the mistreat of white people to black people in South Africa.
    Therefore
    forgiving is not forgetting rather it is remembering-remembering and not using it to hit back.
    <br><br><br>

    <span>b. The author interprets &quot;I am sorry&quot; as three hardest words to say. How does it apply to your life?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Committing mistakes are the part of human life. But accepting it and apologizing for it is the hardest task. In the
    text, the author interprets &ldquo;I am sorry&rdquo; as three hardest words to say. Empathy is the ability to put
    ourselves in another person&rsquo;s shoes and feel what they feel. This is something we need to develop. It takes
    humility. Too often, we are preoccupied with our own feelings. Empathy is the recognition that it&rsquo;s not all
    about
    us. Other people matter. They have feelings, too, and those feelings are important. By saying we are
    sorry&mdash;sincerely and with authentic humility&mdash;we validate them as human beings.
    <br>
    For me the three words &quot;I am sorry&quot; are hardest words to say when I hurt others. Instead to say sorry, I
    remain aloof to them who have been hurt by me and don't go close to them to talk again. I don't talk and be close to
    them unless they come to speak to me. I am so much proudly and sensitive person. I easily get hurt by other and feel
    sad
    and I wish them to come close to me and say &quot;sorry&quot;. But I never realize how much they are affected by my
    misbehavior. I feel very uneasy and difficult to say, &quot;I am sorry.&quot; Thus, as a matter of pride, fear of
    being
    shameful, lack of awareness, sense of superiority, gap in understanding, overwhelming emotion of guilt etc. also
    makes
    me hard to say the three words &ldquo;I am sorry&rdquo;.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <br>
    <span>
        The author talks about dual education system based on race in South Africa in the second half of the twentieth
        century.
        We also have private schools and public schools in Nepal. What should be done to make education equal to all
        citizens of
        Nepal? Write a couple of paragraphs expressing your views.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    Nepal has come a long way in improving equity in education. In most countries, factors like income, geography,
    gender,
    language and disability contribute to inequitable access and high drop-out rates. Nepal&rsquo;s education system has
    faced many problems since the mid-1800s. The first education system in Nepal was only available to elite families,
    and
    Nepali people did not have access to education until 100 years later in the 1950s. Current day education in Nepal is
    still in the developing stage and did not really start integrating the use of technology in the classroom until
    2007.
    <br><br>
    To illustrate the issues that Nepal&rsquo;s public school systems face, the children need access to clean drinking
    water
    while they attend school as well as at home. The lack of water and high temperatures result in the children having
    difficulty concentrating and comprehending the material at hand. Thus, this combined with child malnutrition in
    Nepal,
    children in public schools do not have an advantage to performing well and tend to fall behind or drop out of
    school.
    Given these facts, Nepal&rsquo;s school system is indeed fairly new and continuing to develop, but there is still
    limited access to public schools. This limited access is a result of isolation of women from continuing education
    which
    leads families into poverty. In Nepal, there is an additional factor of caste and ethnicity which further aggravates
    this situation. While the caste system was legally abolished in the 1960&rsquo;s, its legacy continues to impact the
    population for many years thereafter, and people considered low-caste are often economically and socially
    disadvantaged.
    In the past, children from such castes did not have access to schools. This has now changed with government
    initiatives
    such as school enrollment campaigns and scholarships for marginalized children.
