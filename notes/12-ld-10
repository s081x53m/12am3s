    <h3>Comprehension</h3>
    <br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>a. What does a CV mean and why is it important in one&rsquo;s career?</span>
    <br>
    Curriculum vitae is a Latin term that literally means &lsquo;course of life&rsquo;. In practice, it is a
    document that sets out a whole host of your personal details, experience and achievements as they relate to your
    working life.
    <br>
    It is important because it provides with a crucially important opportunity to reflect on and plan further
    developments in one&rsquo;s career. It is need when applying for jobs, seeking promotion and trying to get
    research funding.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. Does the same CV work for all job opportunities? Why or why not?</span>
    <br>
    Yes, the same CV works for all job opportunities but it&rsquo;s better to make slight tweaks to ensure that the
    CV highlights your most relevant skills and qualifications on the basis of job description and uses terminology
    found in the job listing.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. What are the different areas where CV can help you?</span>
    <br>
    A good CV is required when applying for jobs, seeking promotion and trying to get research funding. It helps for
    things such as when you&rsquo;re asked to be an external examiner for a course or a research thesis; for audits
    of teaching and research activity; if your faculty or department has to be validated by an external professional
    body &ndash; in short, any circumstances in which somebody needs to judge your individual professional
    competence or that of you and your colleagues collectively.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. What do you mean by &lsquo;staying CV&rsquo; and &lsquo;leaving CV&rsquo;? Which one would you develop for yourself as a freshman?</span>
    <br>
    A &lsquo;staying CV&rsquo; is that of the good university citizen, including plenty of committee work and
    administration, pastoral care of students, a heavy teaching load as well as a credible research record. A
    &lsquo;leaving CV&rsquo; is that which reflect the interests of a prospective new employer and will probably
    highlight research achievements, while still showing that you are generally competent and willing across the
    range of duties undertaken by academics.
    <br>
    I would develop a leaving CV for myself as a freshman.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. How can you draft a good CV?</span>
    <br>
    One can draft a good CV with the help of your friends, family, mentors and more experienced colleagues. A basic
    framework can be used to structure your recollections and thinking. You should show your draft CV to people who
    know you and/or who know what an academic CV should look like and ask for feedback. In this way, you can draft a
    good CV.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>f. What is the difference between academic CV and non-academic CV?</span>
    <br>
    There are two key differences between academic and non-academic CVs. One is that academic CVs tend to be quite a
    bit longer than those of non-academics, and they get longer as a person&rsquo;s career develops. A second, and
    perhaps more fundamental, difference is that non-academics, especially when they are seeking middle management
    positions, are frequently encouraged to make largely unverifiable assertions about their qualities and skills
    rather than to list verifiable achievements.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. CV may not represent a person&rsquo;s skills and abilities accurately because one&rsquo;s confidence cannot
        be rendered in a paper. What do you think the employers should do to find the best people for the job?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    It&rsquo;s true that CV may not represent a person&rsquo;s skills and abilities accurately because one&rsquo;s
    confidence cannot be rendered in a paper. Employers prefer candidates who can communicate effectively. Oral and
    written communication is a key skill needed in almost every job. In my view, instead of judging the ability of a
    person by a piece of paper, employers can divide the selection process in three steps. First step is to get
    acquainted with the willing participants. Employers can introduce their company terms and conditions to the
    participants and if they think they can work under the conditions, then they can be invited for further process.
    Next step is cover letter explanation. In this step the employers should judge the person&rsquo;s behaviors,
    skills, their character and ability whether they could perform well in the company or not. Last but not the
    least step is calling the selected candidate to participate intelligently to join colleagues at weekly Friday
    lunch where everyone &ldquo;talked shop&rdquo;. Employees are meant to work in team. So only a person should not
    take their interview. Every person who is already in the company should get a chance to talk to them and decide
    whether they can work with him/her or not. These are the things the employers should do to find the best people
    for the job rather than focusing on CV only.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        b. If the employers provide job opportunity by assessing one&rsquo;s CV, how can fresh graduates compete with
        the experienced competitors?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    In today&rsquo;s competitive job market, having a degree and doing good work unfortunately may not be quite
    enough to land you the job you. In order to get yourself one step closer than other graduates to your dream job,
    you have to stand out from the crowd and make a good impression on your potential employers.
    <br>
    <br>
    For some careers you will be required to have achieved a good degree in a specified area, however a lot of the
    time employers are looking for more than just a great set of exam results in their prospective employees. They
    want candidates with personality and the right combination of soft skills, in areas such as interpersonal and
    leadership. Many fresh graduates have no idea on how to write a good CV. Most use the same resume template and
    end up having CVs with similar format. To make yours stand out, you should break the mould and be creative. If
    you&rsquo;re applying for a creative industry, you may wish to opt for something a bit out-of-the-box or
    visually impressive that will really make it stand out from others. By doing this a fresh graduate can compete
    with the experienced competitors.&#8195;

    to work at any of the branches.
