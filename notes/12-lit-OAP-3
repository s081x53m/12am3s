    <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
    <br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>a. Why have Gore and Jitman come to see Laxminarayan?</span>
    <br>
    Gore and Jitman have come to see Laxmi Narayan because they want to tell him about the death of King
    Ranabahadur&rsquo;s bull.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. What, according to cowherds, is the reason behind the death of Male?</span>
    <br>
    According to cowherds, the reason behind the death of the male was that he couldn&rsquo;t eat more grass and
    couldn&rsquo;t digest fine rice and a split gram soup.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. Why does Ranabahadur want to see the bull himself?</span>
    <br>
    Rana Bahadur wants to see the bull himself because he wants to see and examine the condition of the bull. He
    wants the bull to be cured if possible at Gauchar, Kathmandu so it doesn&rsquo;t need to be transported to a
    hill.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. Why does Laxminarayan run ahead of the convoy at Thulo Gauchar?</span>
    <br>
    Laxminarayan runs ahead of the convoy at Thulo Gauchar because he wants to convey the message to cowherds to
    tell them to take care of the bull. He urges to massage the bull&rsquo;s back feet and wave the fan at the bull.
    In actuality, he wants to show king Rana bahadur shah that they are taking care of the bull. If not, the king
    would become angry and he would punish them.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. Why do Gore and Jitman cry when the king declares that Male is dead?</span>
    <br>
    Gore and Jitman cry when the king declares that male is dead to show their supposed sympathy and affection for
    the bull. They cry in a pompous manner, seeking the king's forgiveness. They want an excuse from the king's
    punishment. Otherwise, the king may become enraged and may punish them, making them responsible for the bull's
    death.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>f. How do we learn that the bull is dead?</span>
    <br>
    There are various indications of the bull's death. The conversation between cowherds, Laxminarayan and the king
    clearly indicates the death of the bull. Alongside the physical appearance of the bull as his eyes are
    motionless, tail has loosened, it was breathless and ears were dropped down and he was unable to eat anything.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>g. How does the play make a satire on the feudal system?</span>
    <br>
    The play &lsquo;the bull&rsquo; written by Bhimnidhi Tiwari is one of the mirrors of the feudal system and its
    terrific act. The horrible acts towards ordinary people by the feudal system have been tried to show as it was
    then in the play. The domination and dehumanization towards ordinary people have been tried to portray in the
    play. The feudal system at its best is cruel and doesn&rsquo;t value the people. In the play, the survived
    cowherds are presented in such a panic even though they have survived by the mercy of their lord. The play shows
    that the king&rsquo;s animal receives more respect, comfort and care than the people there. The people there are
    living in terror and they are hiding their reality in order to save their lives in front of the king. Thus the
    play satires on the feudal system showing that the oppression and dehumanization of king&rsquo;s worker.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>h. Write down the plot of the play in a paragraph.</span>
    <br>
    The play &lsquo;The Bull&rsquo; was written by well-known Nepali poet and dramatist, Bhimnidhi Tiwari. The plot
    of this play shows the emotional connection between bull and King Rana Bahadur Shah.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. Discuss the late eighteenth-century Nepali society as portrayed in terms of the relation between the king and
        his subjects as portrayed in the play.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    As we know, during the eighteenth century the monarchy system was prevalent in Nepal. Nepal was ruled by the
    shah dynasty. They were used to being strict and so is the Nepalese society. People&rsquo;s choices were under
    the king&rsquo;s or ruler&rsquo;s dominance. They weren&rsquo;t free to conduct their lives.
    <br>
    <br>
    The same similarity is portrayed in the play &lsquo;the bull&rsquo;. It shows a horrible society in which people
    are compelled to lavender the terror of kings or lords. Their masters treated them horrifically. Also if they or
    their opinion went against the masters, they were punished. This play shows the miserable life condition of
    Nepalese society.
    <br>
    <br>
    People were not given even fundamental rights. They were deprived of political and financial knowledge. They
    were bound by patriarchal rules and ideals. The society was purely male dominated. Men&rsquo;s were allowed to
    marry multiple wives. In this play, Laxminarayan also has seven wives. And the king had complete control over
    the lives of common people.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        b. What does the relation between Laxminarayan and his wives tell us about the society of that time? To what
        extent has the Nepali society changed since then?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Laxminarayan is the main character of the play and a Forty years old legal officer and king's bull's doctor.
    Taking the scenario of his relationship with his wives, he has seven wives. Yet he is not satisfied with all of
    them and he is planning to marry his eighth wife. He calls his wives with different nicknames. This practice of
    having more wives shows about the male dominant society. Men&rsquo;s are allowed to marry multiple wives whereas
    women&rsquo;s are compelled to live their life under the full dominance and violence of their husband.
    Women&rsquo;s were illiterate and unconscious about their rights. People and especially women&rsquo;s are
    deprived of political and financial knowledge. Child marriage was prevalent at that time. The society was
    reliant under male supremacy.
    <br>
    <br>
    But the Nepalese society has altered this situation dramatically since then. The current situation of Nepali
    society and especially Nepali women is significantly better. Human rights and women rights are there to protect
    them with their basic rights. The literacy rate of women has also increased substantially. They were in a higher
    power of economic and political authority. The concept of equality and equity is operational in Nepalese
    society. Many of the patriarchal traditions like child marriage and prathas are at the end. Many organizations
    are working for the betterment of women. Overall the society is significantly changed.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        c. Shed light on the practice of chakari as portrayed in the play. Have you noticed this practice in your
        society?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    The practice of chakari was prevalent and very popular during the king&rsquo;s rule. During the royal system,
    there used to be a craze or we can say majority of people were involved in the chakari of their leaders,
    monarchs and lords. Chakari was famous for gaining wealth or gifts from the king. They aimed to please the king
    by doing chakari and receiving the wealth. They do chakari in the hope of their advancement of life and living
    but meanwhile there are serious consequences if they do not perform correctly.
    <br>
    <br>
    The practice of chakari was shown very perfectly in the play too. The play&rsquo;s main character Laxminarayan
    and cowherds Gore and Jitman are frequently seen as doing the chakari of their king .Laxminarayan was once also
    punished due to his bad deed of speaking in loud voice in front of the king. They used to be very anxious from
    the deed of kings. When the bull dies, Laxminarayan is so aware of the king's anger and punishment so he picks
    his moves carefully to save his and cowherds life from severe punishment. In the play it is shown that they are
    calling the bull by &ldquo;the bull sir&ldquo;. Therefore the action of Laxminarayan and cowherds demonstrates
    the chakari they are doing.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. How does Laxminarayan outsmart Rana Bahadur?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Laxminarayan outsmarts Rana Bahadur with his great trickery. Laxminarayan is 40 years old, one of the legal
    officers and doctor of the king&rsquo;s bull. As Gore and Jitman inform him about the death of the king&rsquo;s
    bull, he rushes to the king&rsquo;s palace. He has the amazing talent of flattering the king away from his
    emotion. He knew king will be angry and enraged by the death of bull, so Laxminarayan didn&rsquo;t inform
    immediately. Rather than telling the truth immediately, he tells the bull about the bull&rsquo;s sickness to the
    king. He even tells cowherds to massage and wave fans at the bull. By this action the king believes the bull
    died due to sickness despite excellent care and treatment. It helps to protect the lives of cowherds. This way
    Laxminarayan flattered the king and protected the life of his and cowherds from the king's severe punishment.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. Sketch the character of Laxminarayan.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Laxmi Narayan Dahal is one of the main characters of the play &lsquo;the bull&rsquo;. he is forty years old, one
    of the legal officers and king&rsquo;s bull&rsquo;s doctor. He is married to seven wives. It is shown that he is
    still unsatisfied with all of them despite having seven different women at home. He is planning to marry eighth
    wife. When he learns about the king's bull&rsquo;s death, he flatters the king using his intellectual moves.
    Instead of telling the news immediately, he tells the king about the bull&rsquo;s sickness first. When king
    arrives to the cowshed at thulo Gauchar to see his bull, Laxminarayan tells the cowherds to massage and wave fan
    to the bull in order to please king and save his life .due to this act of Laxminarayan and cowherd, they were
    saved from king&rsquo;s punishment. Therefore, we can say Laxminarayan was a cunning man and he unmastered the
    king with his trickery.
