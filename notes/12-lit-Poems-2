    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <br>
    The poem &quot;Every Morning I Wake&quot; is an extract from Under the Milk Wood. In this poem, Thomas pleads with
    the majestic God to have mercy on the common people who live under the Milk Wood.<br>
    <br>
    This poem is a prayer to the magnificent God made by a tiny creature known as a human being. The speaker of the poem
    is a representative of human kinds who are born to die but nothing. The speaker is a devotee of God and he knows the
    real power of God, so every morning he wakes up he makes a pray to Him for having mercy on every creature. The
    speaker prays not only for his benefit but for the well-being of entire creatures. They are living on this planet
    but the remote control is at the hand of God. God is the creator and destroyer of everything on this planet. The
    speaker prays to Him to have mercy because He is immortal and Almighty. <br>
    <br>
    As mortal beings, we have to die but the blessings of God make our life beautiful. The speaker is praying to God
    before he sleeps at night but is not certain if they will see him tomorrow morning so he is asking to bless them. We
    may be good or bad in the course of living our everyday lives, but it is only God who knows our best side. The
    blessings of God every night make us able to see them tomorrow morning. So, the speaker bows down and pray to God to
    keep them alive throughout the night. This time the speaker bides goodbye but not forever though it is not certain
    to be able to wake up the following morning.

    <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.<br></span>
    <br>
    <span>a. When does the speaker pray to the Lord?<br></span>
    The speaker prays to the Lord in the morning time and evening time.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. What does the speaker pray for?<br></span>
    The speaker prays for the grace, sympathy and protection from the god to the residents of Milk wood.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. Who are the &lsquo;poor creatures&rsquo;? Why does the speaker call them &lsquo;poor creatures&rsquo;?<br></span>
    The &lsquo;poor creatures&rsquo; mean all the innocent creatures that are on planet earth. However, in the prayer,
    the speaker is referring the residents of Milk wood as poor creatures. They are referred to as &quot;poor
    animals&quot; by the speaker since they are made up of &quot;bone and flesh&quot; and are destined to die.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. What does Milk Wood sound like? A type of wood or a place? Why?<br></span>
    Milk Wood sounds like a place because there is no use of article before this noun. If it is a type of wood. An
    article either &lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;an&rsquo; or &lsquo;the&rsquo; must have been used according to grammatical
    rules. Articles are unnecessary before the singular proper noun that refers to a specific place.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. Why do the inhabitants of Milk Wood bow to the setting sun &lsquo;but just for now&rsquo;?<br></span>
    The inhabitants of Milk Wood bow to the setting sun just for saying goodbye only to that evening. They hope to see
    the shining sun the following morning. They want to live another day by the grace of God along with the warmth of
    the Sun.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Reference to the context<br></h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. Discuss &ldquo;Every Morning When I Wake&rdquo; as a prayer to the God.<br></span>
    <br>
    Dylan Thoma's &quot;Every Morning When I Wake&quot; is a prayer poem. In a prayer poem, the speaker asks God for
    blessings and guidance throughout his life and the lives of all human types and animals. &quot;Dear Lord, a small
    prayer I make/O please do keep Thy loving eye/on all poor creatures born to die,&quot; from these lines we can say
    the speaker is praying to God. The speaker is pleading with God to maintain his loving gaze on all of creation and
    to shower blessings on them.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. Why does the speaker make a prayer to the God, but not to a king, a billionaire or a scientist?<br></span>
    <br>
    The speaker knows well that none can be above god. As God is the Supreme Being, the source of all creation, and the
    principal object of faith, the speaker offers a prayer to Him. A king is crowned because of God, a scientist learns
    new things because of God, and a millionaire is wealthy because of God. They are unable to safeguard us in the same
    way that God does. God has authority over everyone and everything, even them. No matter how strong, wealthy, or
    knowledgeable someone is, they can never be compared to God. That is why we worship him in order to get his
    forgiveness and benefits. All humans, whether they kings, millionaires, or scientists, are composed of bone and
    flesh and are destined to die. A monarch, a millionaire, or a scientist are all just transient beings. That's why
    the speaker prays to the god.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. How does the poet highlight the magnificence of the God?<br></span>
    <br>
    = The poet highlights the magnificence of God by pointing out that he watches over and cares for all of creation
    from the moment they are born until they die. The speaker knows well that no one can be above god. Because God is
    the ultimate entity, the source of all creation, and the focus of all religious belief, the speaker offers a prayer
    to Him. He has all three attributes: power, knowledge, and actuality. Poet mentions that God guards us from the
    unknown, protects us from uncertain mishaps and that he is the only Supreme Being who understands our best
    interests. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. How does the rhyme scheme of the poem reinforce its message?<br></span>
    <br>
    A rhyme scheme is the ordered pattern of rhyming words at the end of each line of a poem. This poem has coupled
    rhyme in which every two lines of each stanza rhyme together. In AABB rhyming scheme line 1 rhymes with line 1 and
    line 3 rhymes with line 4. The whole poem has a rhyming scheme of AABB, CCDD, EEFF, GGHH. Such rhymes sound like
    pleasant songs. Because of its simplicity, it expresses innocent nature. The speaker is an innocent being in front
    of God. Most of the prayer-poems follow this type of rhyme scheme to make an innocent appeal to God. <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Reference beyond the text<br></h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. Does the God exist? Give your opinion.<br></span>
    <br>
    &quot;Does God exist?&quot; is the most important question which has been discussed since the beginning of human
    civilization. Generally, two types of people are found on the planet based on the belief in the existence of God.
    Some people who prefer to call themselves 'atheists' don't believe that God exists and 'theists' believe in the
    existence of God. <br>
    <br>
    No. matter some people deny the existence of God, for me, God does exist. Some people argue that God doesn't exist
    because nobody has seen Him physically yet or our sensory perceptions don't feel and experience the presence of God.
    But it doesn't mean that things do not exist if we don't feel or see them through our sense organs. Besides our five
    sensory organs, there is the sixth sense, which makes us able to attain God. It is a power of perception, unlike our
    five senses. We are habituated to feel and experience this physical world using our five senses. But humans also
    possess a sixth sense, but we don't use them. People who use the sixth sense believe in the existence of God. It is
    our religious sense. The existence of God is like the existence of radiation. We just see the effects of it. We
    don't see God but we find effects in our lives. Unexpected and miraculous things are the example of the existence of
    God.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        b. In his Epistle to the author of the book, The Three Impostors (1768), Voltaire says, &ldquo;Even if the God
        didn&rsquo;t exist, it would be necessary to invent him.&rdquo; Write an essay highlighting the importance of the
        God in the society.<br>
    </span>
    <br>
    A civilized society must function properly. God is the symbol of all the positive sides of our society and evil is
    the symbol of all negative sides. God guides us on a righteous path. It teaches us moral values, humanity, kindness,
    love, compassion, and so on. He teaches us to give up revenge, greed, passion, desires, and so on. People with good
    qualities make any society civilized. There remains peace and harmony among the people. There is law and order.
    People have fear of God before they commit any crimes. It is because of the fear of God; people don't commit any
    sinful deeds. So it is necessary to create an ideal existence of God even if He doesn't exist.<br>
    <br>
    Most of the people who believe in the existence of our soul even after death, believe in God. The sin they commit
    here, and if they are not repented, their souls will suffer in purgatory. People who follow the path of righteous
    and moral values, after death souls remain in heaven peacefully. This belief, people follow on, is because of the
    sense of the existence of God. Such beliefs and ideals of the people living in any society make the society
    civilized. So for the betterment of and healthy society, God is needed, if not, He must be invented.<br>
