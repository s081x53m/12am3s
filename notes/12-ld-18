    <br>
    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. Suicidal thoughts came in Beethoven&rsquo;s mind several times but he did not commit suicide and kept on
        composing music. Write a monologue in about 150 words from Beethoven&rsquo;s perspectives describing his
        suicidal
        thoughts and his will to live.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    I was the life of the party. Even when there was no party. I made one happen. I made people laugh. I made myself
    laugh. I worked good and hard to make myself laugh. Lord, you could hear my laugh from a block away.
    <br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Isn't he something, that Beethoven?,&rdquo; people would say. &ldquo;Always happy. Look at him. Always with
    the smile.&rdquo; In this situation, I'm feeling quite lonely and helpless. My condition has isolated me from my
    coworkers and relatives. They think negatively about me. They consider me a deaf guy. The entire efforts of my life
    to make music alive and people of the world proud would go in vain. I can't stand this situation in my life. There
    is no hope within me to get cured. It wore me out sometimes, working like that, keeping the motor running, the horn
    honking, the smoke pouring out. Sometimes I just wanted to come to rest. So today, I made a mistake. I stayed alone.
    And then I decided, that's what I'll do. I'll just stop. I'll rest.
    <br>
    <br>
    Later the day, I think it's bad to kill my own life. I must try to conquer these suicidal thoughts. I should think
    about the ethics of life and my interest in music. People say that a man should not give up his life because he can
    do many other good things in life. Why do I have those thoughts? I can make everyone think that I am normal, that I
    am coping, and that I am fine. I think to myself, suicide is not a permanent solution to a temporary problem'. Human
    life is precious and important. I&rsquo;m ready to leave this miserable thoughts! I&rsquo;m ready for a real life.
    It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I can&rsquo;t listen to others. I&rsquo;m going to listen to my inner sounds and
    feelings!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <span>
        b. Was it divine inspiration or rigorous practice that made Beethoven one of the world&rsquo;s greatest
        musicians?
        Give the reasons.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    No, it wasn't divine inspiration but rigorous practice and his belief in music that made Beethoven one of the great
    composers of the world. Ludwig van Beethoven was a German pianist and composer widely considered to be one of the
    greatest musical geniuses of all time. His innovative compositions combined vocals and instruments, widening the
    scope of sonata, symphony, concerto and quartet.
    <br>
    <br>
    Beethoven&rsquo;s personal life was marked by a struggle against deafness, and some of his most important works were
    composed during the last 10 years of his life, when he was quite unable to hear. He went on singlehandedly to change
    the musical world forever. Due to his deafness, he became quite sad and serious. In that suffering too, he didn't
    give up his passion for his music and continued his creative works further. He kept on composing his best music even
    after his deafness. Due to his rigorous practice and musical devotion, his music career reached its height and made
    him quite popular not only within his country but across the globe. It has been said that he alone dragged music out
    of the Classical age and into the Romantic. But that doesn&rsquo;t go far enough. I believe passionately that
    Beethoven both defined and deserves his own musical era.

    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Swar Samrat Narayan Gopal Guruacharya</p>
    <br>
    Narayan Gopal was born to a Newar family in Kathmandu in 1996 Bikram Sambat (BS). His father was a classical
    musician and wanted his son to follow his footsteps. Narayan Gopal was interested in music from an early age but not
    exactly into classical field. Regarded one of the most significant cultural icons in Nepal, he is referred as
    &quot;Swar Samrat&quot; in Nepal. He is also known as &quot;King of Tragedy&quot; owing to his numerous tragedy
    songs. He also sang in Nepal Bhasa.
    <br>
    <br>
    Narayan Gopal is by far the most prominent and popular singer in Nepali music. When people think or talk about
    Nepali music, the name most associated is that of Narayan Gopal. For most people, he is the singer. He was also an
    accomplished music composer in his own right. Not only was he gifted with a great voice, he was very versatile. His
    voice range allowed him to sing songs of every genre. His songs are often richly orchestrated with the sitar,
    harmonium and the flute. Some of his most popular songs include: Euta Manche Ko Maya le Kati, Jhareko Paat Jhai, Yo
    Samjhine Man Cha, Saawan ko jhari bani, Manche ko Maya and many more.
    <br>
    <br>
    He has sung over 500 songs, including in films, ballets and drama. Most of his songs are melodies. It is said that
    he was very selective about which songs he sang. Although 500 songs is not a lot for some of his caliber, they are
    outstanding in some ways&ndash;be it the lyrical depth or superb rendition. In recognition of his contribution in
    the field of Nepali music, he has received several national honors and awards, Trishakti Patta, Chinnalata Puraskar
    to name a few.
    <br>
    <br>
    Continued sales of his albums attest to his immense popularity. Even more than a decade after his death, his songs
    are equally liked, loved and sung. His legacy lives on.
