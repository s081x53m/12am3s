    <h3>Comprehension</h3>
    <br>

    <span>A. Choose the best answer.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    a. The author of the text above has the opinion that Julia Hill <b>
        made her pastime in a tree for two years
        more.
    </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    b. The sentence &lsquo;Julia had occasional visitors&rsquo; indicates she had <b>a few visitors now and then.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    c. The logging company managed 24 hour security service around the tree to <b>discourage her from her campaign.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    d. Ms. Hill began to respond the loggers with songs and conventional conversations because she <b>
        had unconditional
        love for all nature&rsquo;s creations.
    </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    e. Julia Hill climbed down the tree after 738 days when her demands were <b>about to be fulfilled.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <span>B. Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>a. Who was Julia Butterfly Hill? How did Hill&rsquo;s campaign gain popularity?</span>
    <br>
    Julia Butter Jill was a person who lived in a 200-ft-tall redwood tree for more than two years to draw attention
    to the continued clearcutting of California&rsquo;s remaining redwood forests. Her campaign gained popularity
    when she started to have occasional visitors.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. What made Hill start her mega campaign to save redwood trees?</span>
    <br>
    When she arrived in the redwood forest, she was gripped by the spirit of the forest. She dropped to her knees
    and began to sob seeing the clearcutting of redwood trees. She sat and cried for a long time and finally decided
    to start her mega campaign to save redwood trees.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. What kinds of amenities were there to support Hill&rsquo;s life in the tree?</span>
    <br>
    Hill had a sleeping bag, a solar-powered cell phone for media interviews, and a single-burner propane stove to
    cook and heat water to support her life in the tree. She had few necessities, and no luxuries.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. Did Hill's value of life change after her car accident? How?</span>
    <br>
    Yes, Hill&rsquo;s value of life changed after her car accident. She said the experience was a wake-up call.
    Before accident her main focus had been work but later on she became clear that value as people is not in their
    stock portfolios and bank accounts, but it is in the legacies they leave behind.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. Deforestation causes natural calamities. What evidence do you have in the text to prove this?</span>
    <br>
    Yes it&rsquo;s true that deforestation causes natural calamities. In the text we can see that the cutting of
    redwoods destabilized the hillside and caused the mudslide which carried trees, stumps and debris from that
    hillside down into the town, leaving seven families without homes.
    <br>
    <br>

    <span>f. How did the logging company try to discourage Hill in the early days of her sit-in?</span>
    <br>
    The logging company tried to discourage Hill in the early days of her sit-in by hiring 24-hour security guards
    to harass her and to ensure her support team couldn&rsquo;t deliver her supplies. She was menaced with a
    helicopter at a dangerously close range. A neighboring tree was felled, hitting Luna&rsquo;s outer branches and
    nearly causing Hill to fall. She was verbally abused, threatened with violence, rape and death, kept awake with
    floodlights, and bugles and air horns were blown through the night.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>g. How were the vagaries of nature unwelcoming to Hill?</span>
    <br>
    The logging company wasn&rsquo;t her only problem. One of her scariest times was a 16-hour, 70-mph windstorm
    that shredded the tarps that surrounded her, and even ripped huge branches off the tree. When lightning struck
    nearby during an electrical storm, her hair stood straight up. In this way the vagaries of nature were
    unwelcoming to Hill.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>h. What is the purpose of the author to write a review on Hill&rsquo;s book? Do you think the author stands
        for
        ecological sustainability? Give reasons.</span>
    <br>
    The purpose of the author to write a review on Hill&rsquo;s book is to bring a spotlight to the issue of
    deforestation. He wants people to learn about the deforestation and its ill effects through his review and make
    people know about what a person should do to prevent from this should. Yes I think the author stands for
    ecological sustainability.

    <br>

    <b>13. Plot:</b> The story follows a Victorian scientist, who claims that he has invented a device that enables him
    to
    travel through time, and has visited the future, arriving in the year 802,701 in what had once been London. The
    narrator recounts the Traveler&rsquo;s lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply the fourth
    dimension and demonstrates a tabletop model machine for travelling through the fourth dimension. He reveals that
    he has built a machine capable of carrying a person through time and returns at dinner the following week to
    recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator.
    <br>
    <br>

    <b>14. Summary:</b> A group of men, including the narrator, is listening to the Time Traveler discussing his theory
    that time is the fourth dimension. The Time Traveler produces a miniature time machine and makes it disappear
    into thin air. The next week, the guests return, to find their host stumble in, looking disheveled and tired.
    They sit down after dinner, and the Time Traveler begins his story.
    <br>
    <br>

    <b>15. My Impressions:</b> The time traveler&rsquo;s machine is described in such sketchy terms that it can scarcely
    be believed as an instrument of science, and the time traveler&rsquo;s account is similarly sketchy and bizarre.
    The very nature of time travel means that he&rsquo;s away for only a short period of time, and the only
    &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of his travels is a crunched up flower. And given that the narrative is told in a
    twice-removed manner, the reader can&rsquo;t help but wonder whether any of the novels is true at all. Did the
    time traveler truly engage in such chronological shenanigans, and did he experience what he claims? Or is he
    simply using an imagined future to provide a warning about the current state of society? But the reality is that
    neither the truth nor the journey matters: it&rsquo;s only the outcome.

        B. Your school is going to organize a speech competition on coming Friday. The subject of the speech is
        &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s save the trees and protect our environment.&rdquo; Draft a speech using the following
        prompts.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Let&rsquo;s Save the Trees and Protect Our
        Environment</p>
    <br>
    Good morning everyone, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on such an important topic Let&rsquo;s
    Save the Trees and Protect Our Environment. When one thinks of the most important element to survive the answer
    that always comes to our mind is air. Air is important for all living beings be it animals or humans. The trees
    which occupy 32% of the earth&rsquo;s surface provide us with this air.
    <br>
    <br>
    The trees of the planet act as the lungs in our body and purify the air we breathe. It is due to the existence
    of trees we inhale fresh air. As trees inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen which serves as the important
    life source of all living beings. The more trees the planet has the fresher and purer the air we breathe.
    <br>
    <br>
    Man&rsquo;s attempt to outlive nature is costing us an unfortunate price. This drive for civilization and
    modernization is harming the environment and therefore the planet to an irreversible extent. When man violates
    nature the planet suffers and we have to bear the harmful consequences. Let&rsquo;s understand how.
    <br>
    <br>
    The road to civilization is more often through the way by destroying natural resources.
    <br>
    <br>
    Man views trees as roadblocks in modernization, that is they see it as it comes in the way of building more
    buildings and roads. So they tend to deforestation, which is an act of cutting down trees. When trees are cut
    they build more homes and offices in the land.
    <br>
    <br>
    Deforestation leads to many unnatural things that disrupt the balance of nature. Due to deforestation, air
    pollution increases, and global warming rises. Animals lose their home and shelter, the quality of the soil
    where deforestation is practiced deteriorates due to the untimely removal of roots of trees leading to soil
    erosion.
    <br>
    <br>
    As their population is only increasing, it is imperative to have more trees so that the next generation lives
    breathing fresh air. If deforestation continues the planet will not be able to inhabit future generations
    because of the imbalance it experiences.
    <br>
    <br>
    The best way to solve this problem is by avoiding deforestation and moving towards afforestation that is
    planting trees. We should all strive to save our home which is the planet. Even planting one tree can save so
    many lives.
    <br>
    <br>
    It is high time that we take action and protect the environment which nourishes all living and breathing
    creatures. When saving trees they save lives and inevitably save the planet. Saving trees and protecting
    environment is the motto we should all live by. Let&rsquo;s leave behind a green planet for the next generation.
    Spread the word and take action to save trees and in that way, we can protect the environment.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks for the patient hearing!
