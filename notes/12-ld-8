    <br>
    The author describes the Japanese waste management system saying that three nights a week, the residents
    of his neighborhood deposit their household trash at specified areas on the street corners, wrapped in
    neat bundles, like gifts, and it disappears at dawn.
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>b. What are the two reasons behind the existence of sodaigomi in Japanese culture?</span>
    <br>
    The two reasons behind the existence of sodaigomi in Japanese culture are: one is the small size of the
    typical Japanese house and another is the Japanese desire for freshness and purity.
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>c What, according to the author, do the Japanese feel at the thought of buying second hand items?</span>
    <br>
    According to the author, the Japanese feel embarrassment at the thought of buying second hand items.
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>d. How is Malaysian culture different from Japanese culture concerning the used items?</span>
    <br>
    In Malaysian culture no one throws anything away whereas in Japanese culture heaps of clean, new-looking
    merchandise are thrown on the street. Several customer bids enthusiastically for second handed small to
    small things in Malaysia whereas shoppers seem to feel embarrassment at the thought of buying second
    hand items in Japan.
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>e. Why did the author feel awkward at the sodaigomi pile?</span>
    <br>
    The author felt awkward at the sodaigomi pile because he never believed that everything looing perfectly
    clean, whole, and serviceable is thrown out in Japanese culture.
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>f. How many articles did the author bring to his house one after another?</span>
    <br>
    The author laid in as many provisions as he decently could. At first he grabbed an ordinary low Japanese
    tea table. He then brought a shiny new bell for one son's bicycle, a small but attractive wooden
    cupboard, a complete set of wrenches and screwdrivers in a metal toolbox, a Naugahyde-covered barstool
    and a lacquer serving tray.
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>g. Why do most people try to find things in trash pile &lsquo;in the dead of the night&rsquo;?</span>
    <br>
    Most people try to find things in trash pile &lsquo;in the dead of the night&rsquo; because everyone can
    pretend not to notice and they can bring no shame upon their kind.
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>h. How did the author&rsquo;s family assimilate Japanese culture in using consumer goods?</span>
    <br>
    The author&rsquo;s family assimilated Japanese culture in using consumer goods by operating in the dead
    of night to collect the essential materials or goods thrown out in the sodaigomi pile.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. If you happen to be in Japan someday, will you collect articles from sodaigomi? Why or why not?</span>
    <br>
    Yes, I would have collected articles from sodaigomi if I happen to be in Japan someday. I live in the
    country where people only buy the new things after it gets old, damaged and unable to function properly.
    So, living in Japanese culture, following the sodaigomi tradition is not of my kind. It is painful to go
    from the world to one in which we didn't have any household goods, couldn't bring ourselves to buy the
    overpriced new ones in the store - and then saw heaps of clean, new-looking merchandise just sitting on
    the street. By picking up items form sodaigomi, I would save a lot of money and would live a good life.
    So, definitely I will collect articles from sodaigomi instead of going for the new one.

        b. There are some second hand shops in Nepal, too. But, people are not much interested in them. What

    </span>
    <br>
    Some consumers love buying and selling second-hand items due to cost-effectiveness, as well as ethical
    and environmental benefits. But many of the peoples if Nepal are not much interested in them. So to
    encourage second hand shopping in Nepal following things should be considered.
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Second hand shops should partner with the brands that sell well, and provide assistance for
    consignors on what products and what brands are best to consign with.
    <br>
    <br>
    2. A realistic price should be kept by starting with the original value of the newly manufactured item,
    and then reducing it in accordance with wear and tear and extent of usage.
    <br>
    <br>
    3. Providing additional support, such as offering consignment consultations with advice on pricing,
    photographing, and shipping items can encourage more people to buy and sell on these shops.
    <br>
    <br>
    4. Second hand stores have vibrant social media followings and it should work toward getting out to as
    many people as possible.&#8195;
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <br>
    <span>A. Write a paragraph elaborating the idea of 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle) in garbage management.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">3Rs &ndash; Reduce, Reuse &amp; Recycle</p>
    <br>
    The principle of reducing waste, reusing and recycling resources and products is often called the
    &quot;3Rs.&quot; Basically, it is a sequence of steps on how to manage waste properly. Reducing means
    choosing to use things with care to reduce the amount of waste generated. Reusing involves the repeated
    use of items or parts of items which still have usable aspects. Recycling means the use of waste itself
    as resources. The three R's all help to cut down on the amount of garbage we throw away. They conserve
    natural resources, landfill space and energy. Plus, the three R's save land and money communities must
    use to dispose of waste in landfills. Siting a new landfill has become difficult and more expensive due
    to environmental regulations and public opposition.
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        B. Garbage management is a big problem in most of the cities in Nepal. Write a letter to the editor to
        be published in the daily newspaper suggesting the ways of &lsquo;Solving Garbage Problems.&rsquo;

    <br>

    <br>
    To the Editor,
    <br>
    The Kathmandu Post
    <br>

    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Sub : Regarding the news coverage about &lsquo;Solving Garbage
        Problems&rsquo;.</p>
    <br>
    Dear Sir,
    <br>
    I would be grateful if you allow a little space in your widely circulated and popular newspaper. In
    order to draw the attention of the general public as well as the concerning authority of the government
    to the problem of garbage management in most of the cities in Nepal, I am writing you this. We know that
    we have a serious garbage problem. It is clear that there will be no value from waste, as energy or
    material, if it is not segregated. But this is where our waste management system stops short.
    <br>

    <br>
    The problem of waste is something that needs to be handled on a smaller scale and aggregated to solve
    the bigger problem. Waste-pickers already contribute greatly to solving this problem. We need to tap
    into their capacity. An IT platform like I Got Garbage can build business models for wastepickers.
    Instead of picking and dumping garbage from each house, the government can provide subsidy and give
    every home a composter. Landfill sites can never be a solution to solid waste in cities as it is an
    outdated idea. Reduce, Reuse and Recycle are the most common methods to reduce landfill waste. 80
    percent of organic waste littering the streets can be used if the government cooperates with pig farmers
    in the respective cities. I wonder why the authorities are not adopting this method. As long as
    governments try cleaning the city by doing the same things they always did and say they will do it
    better this time, the city won't become cleaner. We need something dramatically different.
    <br>

    <br>
    I hope the concerning authorities will make appropriate steps immediately.
    <br>

    <br>
    Looking forward to seeing an article in this regard in your upcoming publication.
